_As always, this review is not spoiler-free, so go and read the book. There isn't much plot, and what there is is not very important, but still, when you go in cold the originality is so striking, and the experience of reading it so disorientating, that any warning ahead of time in the form of a prosaic review like this is bound to detract from it. Incidentally, I think this goes for every good book; don't listen to all the literary snobs who say that it's impossible to spoil a great work of literature._

## A bad first impression, or, a lesson in how to read Ice

_Ice_ by Anna Kavan is a strange, beautiful, and original novel, but I almost abandoned it in disgust in the very first paragraph when I got to the following line of dialogue, spoken by a garage attendant commenting on the weather:

> "Never known such cold in this month. Forecast says we're in for a real bad freeze-up."

_In this month?_ Who would say that? He would say "in September," "in Spring," or "this time of year."

But I kept going, and soon enough things began to click. I understood that "in this month," beyond just avoiding mention of the time of year, was _openly signalling_ this avoidance, preparing the ground for the consistent avoidance of all specifics throughout the novel. Not only the time of year, but places and people remain unnamed and vague, and all the way to the end the narrative is never properly grounded in events, in people's lives, in actual places, or even in an intelligible passage of time. We never know what is real, and Kavan is saying _it's fine, it's meant to be like this_. It doesn't matter that the garage attendant's words are unnatural, because this is not naturalism, and this is not realist fiction. What Kavan is doing is perspective, not representation. We're in the world of anti-mimetic modernism, in Brian Richardson's terms:

> By **mimetic** I mean fictional representations that resemble nonfictional ones. We can think of a mimetic representation as a generous conception of realism. It treats characters as if they were people, and the events they engage in as essentially similar to the kinds of events we might encounter in our lived experience. Space and time in such fiction are recognizable extensions of the spatial and temporal parameters of our world. The canon of probability that governs the universe is assumed to be largely the same in mimetic fictional worlds.

>
> Represented events that are **antimimetic** ... do not copy or extend but rather violate some of the laws of everyday existence; these events cannot happen in real life. [...] In the real world, time flows forward and the past is unalterable. Antimimetic authors may run time backward and reverse the order of cause and effect; they may change the past or include incompatible versions of it; they may fabricate contradictory temporal sequences as time flows differently for dif- ferent characters; and they may form temporal loops. Such authors may create impossible spaces and feature characters with too few or too many charac- teristics for them to be humanlike.

Back to _Ice_. Just a few pages on, I got stuck again:

> I had not seen all the things I remembered about her.

I couldn't parse this line of narration at all. I read it repeatedly but couldn't work it out. Again I kept going, and again it fell into place: the narrator is admitting that he---unexpectedly, the narrator is male---remembers things that he could not possibly remember, episodes that he was not a part of, that he "had not seen". _Their_ reality is in question too. The natural response to him is to think, well, the fact is that you _don't_ remember these things that you think you remember---but that doesn't occur to the narrator, and we never get that sort of answer in the novel. This is a deeper disruption of realism than the usual technique of the unreliable narrator, in which there is a disjuncture between (a) what the narrator tells you happened, which might be the product of madness of deception, and (b) what really happened, which cashes out in the end, or which everything finally bubbles up to. For example, in Nabokov's _Pale Fire_ or in the works of Gene Wolfe, all the clues are there to allow the reader to work out the truth. But in _Ice_, we never quite bubble up to that objective reality.

The consequence of this is that the narrative slips seamlessly from first to third person at times. In one paragraph the narrator is telling us what he's doing, about the glimpses he gets of the girl in the forest while he tries to follow her, and in the next he is telling us about a private moment between the girl and her husband, without any obvious switch to her point of view. I found this to be one of the strangest things about the book, something I don't think I've seen before. In metafictional terms, with the narrator's early declaration that "I had not seen all the things I remembered about her," it is as if Kavan is saying, "sometimes this is going to slip into the third person without warning."

Kavan thus prepares us for what will come: first, that we will never get to find out the who, what, when, why and where; and second, that we will struggle to find the real among the ... well, it's hard even to state the dichotomy because it's never clear what is opposing the reality---is it fantasy, hallucination, dissociative identity disorder?

They say that great books teach you how to read them, and this seems to be what's happening in the first few pages of _Ice_. The book is disorientating, but thanks to Kavan's hints, not hopelessly so.

## What it's about

Before continuing, I should give an overview. In _Ice_, the narrator-protagonist tells the story of his search for a thin, fragile girl with white-blond hair. She is described several times as translucent or brittle (like ice, which sounds corny and too on-the-nose but isn't, at least not for me). The narrator was once briefly involved or infatuated with her, but now he is positively obsessed, and he attempts to find her after she leaves her husband and leaves the country, moving from town to dreary unwelcoming town by ship. The trouble for our narrator is that she is always difficult to reach and living with another man, first her husband, and later "the warden," who may or may not be the same person. While he searches for her, the world is falling into a nuclear winter following a major war, and conventional wars are now breaking out as the climatic situation becomes more desperate. The global cooling seems to have caused a re-glaciation, such that every place the narrator goes is threatened by an encroaching wall of ice which is killing everything in its path.

Things are grim, and there is no hope. Even so, I found the book compulsive and enjoyable. I didn't think the world would be saved in the end or that the hero would get the girl, but I was fascinated from start to finish.

## Metafiction and experiment

From what I've seen, the metafictional aspect of the novel, mentioned above, doesn't get much attention from reviewers. Maybe it's too obvious. Maybe it's part and parcel of experimental literature. In any case, Kavan continues to drop hints about the narrative while also describing mental states. There are many examples, but here are a few:

> At the same time, there was a curious unreality about the memory of that scene, as if I could have dreamt it.

> The hallucination of one moment did not fit the reality of the next.

> In a peculiar way, the unreality of the outer world appeared to be an extension of my own disturbed state of mind.

> Then another shock, the sensation of a violent awakening, as it dawned on me that this was the reality, and those other things the dream.

As an aside, it's significant that some of these, such as the last one above, have the character of revelation, the moment when the truth is revealed. But that's never the way it goes. Things are never tied up neatly, and we're never closer to finding out what's really going on. The reader is at least as lost as the narrator, who begins the whole story with "I was lost," and never gets himself unlost (his tone of satisfaction and at-home-ness at the end strikes the reader as either unconvincing or insane).

In these comments about what is and what is not real, which are peppered throughout the novel, we feel Kavan herself addressing us through the words of the narrator, such that he could be referring to the book in which he is a character as much as to his state of mind and grasp on reality. To a degree this is _always_ the case in the first person point of view, since the narrator is presented as the storyteller, as the author---but here, Kavan has intentionally made it impossible for the reader to identify the narrator with herself, so the narrator is far from being merely her mouthpiece. Perhaps this is why I label it as metafictional rather than just the usual self-consciousness of a first-person narrator: there is a disconnect between narrator and author, and Kavan draws our attention to this often.

Maybe metafiction is not the right focus. Kavan is first and foremost _experimental_, and experimental fiction is always somewhat metafictional anyway, just because it self-consciously draws attention to itself. But this doesn't necessarily mean that the experimental novel is _about_ itself, or about storytelling. This might be the case for the purest metafiction like Italo Calvino or John Barth, but _Ice_ is, I think, about the real world---it's just that _in_ the real, modern world, what is real is not always easy to work out. And when we do see the world clearly, we see that it's broken.

Another way of putting it is to say that _Ice_ is indeed about storytelling, because forming and maintaining a coherent personality is about storytelling too, and this book reflects or explores what it's like to struggle with that (see the [theory of narrative identity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narrative_identity)). And it's more than just a psychological study: Kavan points her broken lens not only at people and relationships but out towards the whole planet, where all is chaos, fear, and death. The kind of storytelling appropriate to this psychological, social, and planetary situation is not straight realism, but something reflective of fragmentation and doom.

Not long before the publication of _Ice_, Kavan explained her motivation in writing anti-mimetically:

> Haven’t we had enough of realistic descriptions by now? I thought they’d been done so well as they can be done over and over again, and as long ago as Zola etc. I find it hard to make out a convincing case for the continuance of factual writing, when the microphone catches reality and transmits it to millions, who thus acquire their facts far more easily and quickly than by reading the shortest book or seeing a one act play. It certainly seems time for a movement away from realism. [. . .]
>
> You know I’m very interested in this reality thing – in the changes that continually shatter the seemingly objective world, which only our mental and physical health hold together in some sort of equilibrium, and which the least indisposition causes to slip and dissolve in confusion.
>
> --- _Anna Kavan to Raymond Marriott, September 1964, Anna Kavan Papers, quoted in Victorial Walker [2]_

Incidentally, I seem to be attracted to pretty much all anti-mimetic fiction. I don't seem to mind what the author's motivation is or what genre it lies in. Kavan is motivated by an experimental spirit, and that's great, but I'm still interested if the author is just motivated by innocent wonder at the universe, or by the exercise of imagination to no explicit moral or intellectual end, or by concerns about technology, an impish compulsion to build elegant mechanisms out of words, or just sheer perversity. So long as it's not mundane naturalism about the family next door, I might be interested. (Having said that, I do enjoy some nineteenth century realism, e.g., Tolstoy. Maybe it just feels somehow right when it's coming from that era, but boring and inappropriate in modern novels).

## Is there a point to all this?

At every level, Kavan is experimenting. Aside from the _content_---abuse and obsession, the fractured personality, the apocalypse of ice and violence, to pick a few---it is _formally_ innovative, experimenting with time, memory, narration, point of view, language, appearance and reality, and so on. But it's not formally experimental just for fun---there's a point to it.

So, what is it? I've already suggested an answer above, namely to write in a mode appropriate to broken realities and broken minds, eschewing the deceptive security of realism. But that's quite vague. Victoria Walker, in her book _Anna Kavan: Mid-Century Experimental Fiction_, discusses the "ethical value of experiment" in _Ice_. She claims that the novel is a sincere moral response to the real world.

Walker quotes a revealing passage from a 1944 book review by Kavan:

> Any experiment whatsoever, which may shock people into awareness of their responsibility to those undefended ones is of supreme importance. The ethical value of this book can hardly be exaggerated in that it tends, in disturbing the reader’s emotional norm, to force upon him acknowledgement of his own profound implication in the matter.
>
> --- _Anna Kavan, quoted in Victoria Walker [3]_

This passage is infused with moral indignation at the state of the world. That's surely a good response to the Second World War, but what is remarkable is that she sees literary experiment as a tool to oppose social evils. Walker makes the reasonable claim that this is exactly the kind of thing she is doing in _Ice_, even though it was written twenty years later.

There are at least two aspects to it. One is at the level of personal behaviour and relationships, and the other is about humanity. First Walker points out that Kavan's use of the first-person implicates the reader in his acts of brutality and makes it difficult to know who to root for---this is an example of "disturbing the reader’s emotional norm, to force upon him acknowledgement of his own profound implication in the matter". This, by the way, is a bit like the point-of-view character, Bron, in Samuel R. Delany's _Trouble on Triton_, which I [reviewed a short while ago](/trouble-on-triton-samuel-r-delany-1976)---although Delany uses a close third-person POV rather than first-person.

Second, "the matter" that the reader is implicated in can also refer to the end of the world, enacted by the human race in a spectacular planetary murder-suicide.

So it really seems that there's a moral to the story, that the book has an ethical beating heart and that Kavan wants you to get it. This becomes clear in the book towards the end, where humanity comes in for some heartfelt (and beautifully written) condemnation:

> Instead of my world, there would soon be only ice, snow, stillness, death; no more violence, no war, no victims; nothing but frozen silence, absence of life. **The ultimate achievement of mankind would be, not just self-destruction, but the destruction of all life; the transformation of the living world into a dead planet.**
>
> In a sky which should have been cloudless and burning blue the sombre, enormous structures of storm cloud looked inexpressibly sinister, threatening, like monstrous ruins on the point of collapse, hanging impossibly overhead. Icy crystalline shapes began to flower on the windscreen. I was oppressed by the sense of universal strangeness, by the chill of approaching catastrophe, the menace of ruins suspended above; and also by the enormity of what had been done, the weight of collective guilt. **A frightful crime had been committed, against nature, against the universe, against life. By rejecting life, man had destroyed the immemorial order, destroyed the world, now everything was about to crash down in ruins.**

It's interesting that Kavan used the narrator to say all this, since he is, to put it mildly, an ambiguous character. It occurs to me that a more mainstream thing to do here would be to put these words in the mouth of the girl, finally giving her a voice and making her the hero. But that would be too easy. That would wrap things up more than they should be.

The human world for Kavan is, individually and collectively, a great manifold of violence and destruction. It's a common observation that the Second World War continued to haunt writers in the 1960s, that in fact this was the time when writers were just starting to face up to the enormity of what had happened. _Ice_ certainly _feels_ traumatized.

So all the experimentation with form seems to be fruitfully entangled with the content, in a way it's not in, say, Thomas Pynchon's _Against the Day_. In that book, Pynchon condemns capitalism in the strongest terms, but the experimental form of the novel---which switches between the literary modes and tropes of boy's adventure stories, musical comedy, spy thrillers, and so on---seems to have nothing much to do with those ethical and political points. When it's time to express his sincere hatred of capitalism, Pynchon stops playing around and settles on a Dickensian kind of realism to make his points, using the grotesque villain of Scarsdale Vibe.

But in _Ice_, the experimentation and the story are inextricable. To use the technical terms of narratology and to make myself look smart: the _syuzhet_ is the _fabula_. That is, the form of the story's telling is the guts of the story itself. You could write down the basic chronological plot, the _fabula_, in a very few numbered points, but the substance of the story is infinitely rich.

## The prose

In the foreword Christopher Priest says, "Her prose is beautifully measured, sometimes fey, sometimes muscular." I agree, and here's where I'll allow myself a little negative criticism. I confess that occasionally the feyness got too much for me, particularly in the repetitive and somewhat prolix descriptions of ice and snow. And after the bad first impression it did take me a while to get into Kavan's groove. But when I did, I often found the writing to be top flight. Here is an example:

> I dreamed of her whether I was asleep or awake. I heard her cry: 'One day I'll go . . . you won't see me again. . . .' She had gone from me already. She had escaped. She hurried along a street in an unknown town. She looked different, less anxious, more confident. She knew exactly where she was going, she did not hesitate once. In a huge official building she made straight for a room so crowded she could hardly open the door. Only her extreme slimness enabled her to slip between the many tall silent figures, unnaturally silent, fantastically tall, whose faces were all averted from her. Her anxiety started to come back when she saw them towering over her, surrounding her like dark trees. She felt small and lost among them, quickly became afraid. Her confidence had vanished; it had never been real. Now she only wanted to escape from that place: her eyes darted from side to side, saw no door, no way out. She was trapped. The faceless black tree- forms pressed closer, extended arm-branches, imprisoning her. She looked down, but was still imprisoned. Filled trouser-legs, solid treetrunks, stood all around. The floor had become dark earth, full of roots and boles. Quickly looking up at the window, she saw only white weaving meshes of snow, shutting out the world. The known world excluded, reality blotted out, she was alone with threatening nightmare shapes of trees or phantoms, tall as firs growing in snow.

## Influences, similarities

I can see the influence of Kafka, but that's always brought up in reviews of _Ice_, so I'll mention some others I thought of while I was reading.

When the narrator begins to travel by ship in search of the girl, everything is dreamlike, floaty, and indistinct, and feels exactly like _The Dream Archipelago_ by Christopher Priest. The whole feeling in fact is _uncannily_ similar. Now it turns out Priest must have lifted the mood and style straight from _Ice_; he wrote the foreword to the edition I have and he has been open elsewhere about the influence it had on him. (Which is cool; great artists steal and all that).

I can see the influence in M. John Harrison's _The Sunken Land Begins to Rise Again_, although Harrison is more irritating in his intentional vagueness and ambiguity than Priest or Kavan are in theirs.

Ballard sprung to mind too, particularly _The Unlimited Dream Company_ (his catastrophe novels would be a more natural comparison, but I haven't read them). I'm beginning to see that the whole British New Wave of science fiction might have been centrally inspired by Anna Kavan. In any case, Priest, Ballard, and Brian Aldiss all had good things to say about _Ice_, and it's clear that it had a big and lasting influence on SF more widely, even though it's doubtful whether it can be categorized as SF itself.

Kazuo Ishiguro's _The Unconsoled_ has a similarly disorientating first-person narrative about a man traveling about while his identity, his relationships, and his circumstances shift and jump, and we feel a constant pressure and anxiety that never lets up, almost like the encroaching ice.

Last but not least, Robert Aickman's "strange tales," as he liked to call them, share with _Ice_ the unmoored, uncanny mood, and a refusal to let the reader get a grip on places and identities.

## Conclusion

There is a lot more to say. _Ice_ is so rich that it's difficult to know what to say, and it feels like I've barely scratched the surface. I'll definitely read it again, and when I do I'll probably write a fresh review. As a reminder partly to myself, here are a few things I didn't cover:

* The settings: grim crumbling seaside towns, superstitious fishing villages in Norway
* The girl: as mostly silent, as victim, as a sacrifice to a sea-dragon, as object of male obsession, as property, as absent centre of the novel
* The warden: is he just an aspect of the narrator? Is he the husband? Is there an answer at all?
* The narrator's fantasies of violence
* The indris: the lemurs that, together with their idyllic rainforest setting, seem to be the only ray of light in the whole novel
* The trial, a memorable scene that's quite different from the rest of the book
