I read this book when I was a teenager and it left a trace of wonder and weirdness, but all I actually remembered were some crazy plants, the giant spider things, and the colonization of the protagonist's mind by a fungus. I've just read it again and that tantalizing ghost is now gone; while I thought the first part (up to page 72) was good, I did not like the following two parts, which make up the rest of the book.

The setting is Earth billions of years in the future. The planet is [tidally locked](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidal_locking): never rotating, it has one side perpetually exposed to the Sun, which is fixed in the sky. On top of that, the aging Sun has become hotter. The result is a world of supersized, superabundant, supercharged vegetation in which all but a few species of animals have been squeezed out of existence. A single banyan tree dominates all land on this side of the planet, and in and around it lives a chaotic profusion of plants, many of them predatory, and many of them having convergently evolved to fill niches once filled by animals. Thus there exist diverse vegetal monsters competing in a ferocious war of domination and survival, preying on other plants and also occasionally on the few remaining human beings. These tiny green humans have to fight to survive in a brutally hostile jungle, in which almost everything is "green in tooth and claw," as Aldiss puts it.

The first part of the story is told in the mythic mode of an ancient saga. It's done with a light touch and contributes to the sense of wonder generated by the unhurried world-building. We learn about the world as we go along, as we see events unfolding from the point of view of a small group of humans. The group has important cultural traditions, such as a matriarchal social structure in which women do all the work and face all the danger while the precious males, though highly valued, are generally passive; and an elaborate death rite involving carved wooden objects, possessed by each person, representing their souls.

This first part of the book is very good --- the world-building is imaginative, fascinating, and woven into the action. A moment that I think had stayed with me since since my first read was the group's first experience of the sea. The evocation of the frenzied battle between the coastal vegetation and the seaweeds is terrifying.

The rest of the book often made me cringe. Everything, especially depth of character, is overtaken by the most tediously linear adventure plot. The first part's seductive leaps of imagination and careful use of specific literary modes --- these all fall away, to be replaced by clichÃ©, dated attitudes, and embarrassing attempts at humour. The turning point in the book comes, perhaps not coincidentally, somewhere in the vicinity of this line:

> "My fruit skin chafes my thighs," Poyly said, with a womanly gift for irrelevance that eons of time had not quenched.

What makes this so disappointing is that it comes shortly after the part of the story that sets up the matriarchal culture, in which the women and girls are the central and most active characters. Thereafter, the female characters are shallow and interchangeable. Gren's initial partner, Poyly, is replaced by Yattamur, who is from another tribe, but nothing distinguishes them. This fact is accidentally symbolized by the "tummy-belly men," who refer to Gren by name but to Yattamur as "sandwich lady," a reference to her only role as the receptacle of Gren's sperm.

To be clear, this is not just a woke misinterpretation or over-reaction. The sexism is an aspect of the book's turn away from the imaginatively bizarre that we find in part one: it's meant to be literally billions of years in the future but it's being narrated by someone who is stuck in the mid-twentieth century. There are both good and bad ways that a work of literature can be of its time. When it exhibits the bad, we say it's _dated_. _Hothouse_, certainly after the first part, is dated in its attitudes, its tropes, and its throwaway pulpy plot-driven story.

As I mentioned, one of the things I originally found fascinating, way back when I was a teenager, was the morel fungus that colonizes Gren's mind. But as with everything else in the book, it utterly lost its charm in the second and third parts.

The book should be commended for its wildly imaginative world-building, but except for part one, I cannot recommend it.
