I read this book when I was a teenager and it left a trace of wonder and weirdness, but all I actually remembered were some crazy plants, the giant spider things, and the colonization of the protagonist's mind by a fungus. I've just read it again and that tantalizing ghost is now gone; while I thought the first part (up to page 72) was good, I did not like the following two parts, which make up the rest of the book.

The setting is Earth billions of years in the future. The planet is [tidally locked](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidal_locking): never rotating, it has one side perpetually exposed to the Sun, which is fixed in the sky. On top of that, the aging Sun has become hotter. The result is a world of supersized, superabundant, supercharged vegetation in which all but a few species of animals have been squeezed out of existence. A single banyan tree dominates all land on this side of the planet, and in and around it lives a chaotic profusion of plants, many of them predatory, and many of them having convergently evolved to fill niches once filled by animals. Thus there exist diverse vegetal monsters competing in a ferocious war of domination and survival, preying on other plants and also occasionally on the few remaining human beings. These tiny green humans have to fight to survive in a brutally hostile jungle, in which almost everything is "green in tooth and claw," as Aldiss puts it.

The first part of the story is told in the mythic mode of an ancient saga. It's done with a light touch and contributes to the sense of wonder generated by the unhurried world-building. We learn about the world as we go along, as we see events unfolding fromn the point of view of a small group of humans. The group has strong cultural traditions, such as a matriarchal social structure in which women do all the work and face all the danger while the precious males, though highly valued, are generally passive; and an elaborate death rite involving carved wooden objects, possessed by each person, representing their souls. This stuff is great --- it's imaginative, fascinating, and woven into the action.
