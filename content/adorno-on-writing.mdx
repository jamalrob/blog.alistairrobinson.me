The brilliant and beautiful Reflection 51 of Theodor Adorno's _Minima Moralia_, carrying the heading "Memento", is all about writing. Uncharacteristically for Adorno, it begins with eminently reasonable observations and practical advice for writers. Even more unusual in the experience of reading Adorno, these observations and pieces of advice are quite familiar: kill your darlings, avoid cliché, revise revise revise, and so on. 

But it swiftly moves into darker and more philosophically sophisticated territory.

> _Memento._ – A first precaution for writers: in every text, every piece, every paragraph to check whether the central motif stands out clearly enough. Anyone wishing to express something is so carried away by it that he ceases to reflect on it. Too close to his intention, ‘in his thoughts’, he forgets to say what he wants to say.

This has pride of place at the beginning of the piece, almost like a foundation. It is a "first precaution," which looks a lot like a first principle, the axiom from which everything is spun out. As such, it rubs me the wrong way. Adorno presumably means his advice to apply to literary fiction, not just philosophy—more than pure philosophy and sociology, in his work he was concerned with literature, visual art, and above all music—and especially in fiction I am very sceptical of the idea that one must always be developing _themes_. I feel like the creation of intricate glittering objects and wonder-making concepts and the playful exploration of language are equal to the task of great literature, without any conscious expression of a theme.

So to begin with, I'm not totally on board, but I do see that it's in line with his views on art more generally.

> No improvement is too small or trivial to be worthwhile. Of a hundred alterations each may seem trifling or pedantic by itself; together they can raise the text to a new level.

I probably like this advice because it stamps a seal of approval on my fanatical drive to improve my own pieces of writing.

> One should never begrudge deletions. The length of a work is irrelevant, and the fear that not enough is on paper, childish. Nothing should be thought worthy to exist simply because it exists, has been written down. When several sentences seem like variations on the same idea, they often only represent different attempts to grasp something the author has not yet mastered. Then the best formulation should be chosen and developed further. It is part of the technique of writing to be able to discard ideas, even fertile ones, if the construction demands it. Their richness and vigour will benefit others at present repressed. Just as, at table, one ought not eat the last crumbs, drink the lees. Otherwise, one is suspected of poverty.

This is "kill your darlings," but argued persuasively with originality and depth. One must discriminate, not just write down everything that occurs to one.

"Their richness and vigour will benefit others at present repressed. Just as, at table, one ought not eat the last crumbs, drink the lees. Otherwise, one is suspected of poverty."



> The desire to avoid clichés should not, on pain of falling into vulgar coquetry, be confined to single words. The great French prose of the nineteenth century was particularly sensitive to such vulgarity. A word is seldom banal on its own: in music too the single note is immune to triteness. The most abominable clichés are combinations of words, such as Karl Kraus skewered for inspection: utterly and completely, for better or for worse, implemented and effected. For in them the brackish stream of stale language swills aimlessly, instead of being dammed up, thrown into relief, by the precision of the writer’s expressions. This applies not only to combinations of words, but to the construction of whole forms. If a dialectician, for example, marked the turning-point of his advancing ideas by starting with a ‘But’ at each caesura, the literary scheme would give the lie to the unschematic intention of his thought.

"Truth is objective and not plausible."

The _and_ makes it much more arresting than using _but_, and it's not just an empty gesture. Instead of setting up two opposites facing each other, just in his choice of grammatical construction he emphasizes that the two are as one, intertwined or two sides of the same coin—not in fact opposing at all. It is part of the lesson of dialectics to stop thinking in terms of exclusive dichotomies but to embrace them, seeking not to resolve internal contradictions but see them as constitutive of the object.

> The thicket is no sacred grove. There is a duty to clarify all difficulties that result merely from esoteric complacency. Between the desire for a compact style adequate to the depth of its subject matter, and the temptation to recondite and pretentious slovenliness, there is no obvious distinction: suspicious probing is always salutary. Precisely the writer most unwilling to make concessions to drab common sense must guard against draping ideas, in themselves banal, in the appurtenances of style. Locke’s platitudes are no justification for Hamann’s obscurities.

A fascinating passage, but something of a thicket itself. And this is precisely the issue. In his own prose Adorno tries to walk the narrow line between simplistic platitudes and unnecessary obscurity, but it's _his_ line. He is like the chef who refuses to allow customers to add their own salt: he imposes his own taste on others, ignoring natural variation. Adorno was by most accounts a genius, and a highly educated and cultured one at that, so what counts as the perfect path for him is likely to be far into the territory of the obscure, from the point of view of mere mortals.

> Should the finished text, no matter of what length, arouse even the slightest misgivings, these should be taken inordinately seriously, to a degree out of all proportion to their apparent importance. Affective involvement in the text, and vanity, tend to diminish all scruples. What is let pass as a minute doubt may indicate the objective worthlessness of the whole.

Speaking of misgivings, I am not at all happy with the last paragraph I wrote, concerning Adorno's thicket. Its problems are on two related levels: first, it contains clichés like "mere mortals," and the facile characterization of a passage about obscurity as itself obscure; second, I think it's probably wrong. The latter problem produces the first. The wrongness, which I felt while writing it, produced in me a lack of commitment with a concomitant falling back on easy, trite ideas and phrases.

A writer has no choice but to find that path between obscurity and simplistic "clarity" on their own, according to their own judgement. To accommodate less knowledgeable readers is to dumb down, which is a form of betrayal of one's own ideas, or a form of dishonesty. We value great philosophers partly because they challenge us to meet them on their own turf.

Disentanglement and clarification often—Adorno seems to want to say _always_—amount to over-simplification. In making the readers feel like they have understood, simplification turns difficult matters into digestible bite-size morsels which leave them satisfied and ready to move on to the next course. But Adorno wants readers to be uncomfortable, to remain with the conflicts and contradictions, to chew on what is indigestible. The writer ought to aim to keep things in play rather than using arguments and insights as mere stepping stones on a linear path to a conclusion. The truth lies in the process as much as in the result.

Anyway, returning to this "misgivings" paragraph: we have to watch ourselves, because "affective involvement in the text, and vanity, tend to diminish all scruples." The more our feelings are tied up in a text, the more we are involved in it, the less we will be inclined to listen to our misgivings. But we must. Something artfully constructed might yet be "objectively worthless," because, for example, it does not say what you meant to say.

> The Echternach dancing procession is not the march of the World Spirit;[1] limitation and reservation are no way to represent the dialectic. Rather, the dialectic advances by way of extremes, driving thoughts with the utmost consequentiality to the point where they turn back on themselves, instead of qualifying them. The prudence that restrains us from venturing too far ahead in a sentence, is usually only an agent of social control, and so of stupefaction.

The three steps forward, two steps back movement of the Echternach dancing procession is a timid progression, where what is wanted is a bold movement. Reading today's analytic philosophy one is struck by how much its desire for clarity and precision results in tedious writing which is bogged down in dotting the i's and crossing the t's to pre-empt the crititicisms of the author's peers. Adorno thinks this kind of caution—this fear of writing something wrong or insufficiently warranted—is disabling, and that we advance rather by way of extremes. This brings to mind another thing he was fond of saying: "only exaggeration is true" (itself an exaggeration).

> Scepticism is called for in the face of the frequently raised objection that a text, a formulation, are ‘too beautiful’. Respect for the matter expressed, or even for suffering, can easily rationalize mere resentment against a writer unable to bear the traces, in the reified form of language, of the degradation inflicted on humanity. The dream of an existence without shame, which the passion for language clings to even though forbidden to depict it as content, is to be maliciously strangled.

The objection that writing is too beautiful takes two forms that I can think of. First, there is the criticism of philosophical writing as sacrificing logical rigour and clarity for beauty in expression. I've often heard the complaint, from fans of British and American analytical philosophy, that Continental philosophy is more like poetry than real philosophy. Secondly, there is Adorno's mention of "a writer unable to bear the traces ... of the degradation inflicted on humanity" which suggests he has a different kind of criticism in mind. The idea would be that given the horror of human history, beautiful language is inappropriate, even immoral.

I agree with Adorno that this must be faced with scepticism. But let's have a look at his argument. The full sentence goes like this:

> Respect for the matter expressed, or even for suffering, can easily rationalize mere resentment against a writer unable to bear the traces, in the reified form of language, of the degradation inflicted on humanity.

In other words, these critics disguise mere resentment towards better writers as respect for suffering and for the seriousness of the matter at hand. And crucially, the resentment is directed against those who refuse to bring their language down to Earth, to write plainly, soberly, and transparently, because according to Adorno, such plain writing is in fact degraded by the same social forces that produce suffering on a grand scale. It is conformist language that plays into the hands of oppressive reality. 

He is of course referring to himself throughout this reflection. He is the one who is "unable to bear the traces, in the reified form of language, of the degradation inflicted on humanity." He finds it unbearable, even immoral, to write "normally".

But things are not so simple. If Adorno is famous for anything it's for saying that "To write poetry after Auschwitz is barbaric" (Culture Critique & Society, 1949, in Prisms), and that "After Auschwitz no further poems are possible." (AT, 1970) This seems to be an expression of the very position he is opposing here in _Minima Moralia_, namely the idea that writing ought not to be beautiful in the face of ugly reality. 

The easy way here, i.e., the non-Adornian way, is to resolve this apparent contradiction by saying that he was logically inconsistent, and possibly therefore a bad philosopher. The more interesting path is that of hermeneutic charity: to make the effort to interpret the two positions as somehow consistent. To do so, we have to read on.

> The writer ought not acknowledge any distinction between beautiful and adequate expression. He should neither suppose such a distinction in the solicitous mind of the critic, nor tolerate it in his own. If he succeeds in saying entirely what he means, it is beautiful. Beauty of expression for its own sake is not at all ‘too beautiful’, but ornamental, arty-crafty, ugly. But he who, on the pretext of unselfishly serving only the matter at hand, neglects purity of expression, always betrays the matter as well.

The parallel here is with modern architecture. If we substitute "architect" for "writer" and "structural construction" for "adequate expression," we can see it clearly:

> The architect ought not acknowledge any distinction between beautiful and structural construction.

Adorno is not recommending beauty for its own sake, that is, beauty unrelated to function, is mere ornamentation, something which pretends to be beautiful but which is actually ugly. For Adorno, beautiful language is saying exactly what you mean to say, and nothing more—but without dumbing down. A tricky balancing act.

It becomes clear that when Adorno said that poetry after Auschwitz was barbaric, he was equating poetry with that beauty for its own sake that he has just condemned as mere ornament. _This_ kind of beauty does indeed fail to respect the seriousness of genocide and exploitation. And we should note that in _Negative Dialectics_ he corrected himself:

> Perennial suffering has as much right to express itself as the martyr has to scream; this is why it may have been wrong to say that poetry could not be written after Auschwitz.

Suffering can be expressed in words of beauty which take that suffering seriously, facing up to it and expressing it truthfully, without prettification or the sentimental consolation of the lyrical-romantic turn of phrase, characteristic of pre-modern poetry.

> Properly written texts are like spiders’ webs: tight, concentric, transparent, well-spun and firm. They draw into themselves all the creatures of the air. Metaphors flitting hastily through them become their nourishing prey. Subject matter comes winging towards them. The soundness of a conception can be judged by whether it causes one quotation to summon another. Where thought has opened up one cell of reality, it should, without violence by the subject, penetrate the next. It proves its relation to the object as soon as other objects crystallize around it. In the light it casts on its chosen substance, others begin to glow.



> In his text, the writer sets up house. Just as he trundles papers, books, pencils, documents untidily from room to room, he creates the same disorder in his thoughts. They become pieces of furniture that he sinks into, content or irritable. He strokes them affectionately, wears them out, mixes them up, re-arranges, ruins them. For a man who no longer has a homeland, writing becomes a place to live. In it he inevitably produces, as his family once did, refuse and lumber. But now he lacks a store-room, and it is hard in any case to part from left-overs. So he pushes them along in front of him, in danger finally of filling his pages with them. The demand that one harden oneself against self-pity implies the technical necessity to counter any slackening of intellectual tension with the utmost alertness, and to eliminate anything that has begun to encrust the work or to drift along idly, which may at an earlier stage have served, as gossip, to generate the warm atmosphere conducive to growth, but is now left behind, flat and stale. In the end, the writer is not even allowed to live in his writing.



What about the title, "Memento"?
