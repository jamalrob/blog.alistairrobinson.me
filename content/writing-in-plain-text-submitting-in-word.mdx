For a long time I treated word processors as if they were the enemy: bloated, proprietary, and hostile to thought. I still think some of that criticism is justified. What I no longer think is that refusing Word was the right place to make a stand.

I stopped treating tools as ideological positions and started treating them as phase-specific authorities.

OR 

I used to be an anti–word processor zealot. I avoided Word on principle, not just out of preference, and I had reasons for doing so. What changed was not my view of word processors as such, but my understanding of what problem I was actually trying to solve.

I had been treating a social and institutional problem as if it were a purely technical one.




# OUTLINE 1

## 1. The tension

Writers want clarity, control, and minimal friction while writing.
Editors want Word documents with comments, tracked changes, and familiar tooling.
Both sides usually pretend this mismatch does not exist.



## 2. Why Markdown is not enough

Plain text and Markdown are excellent for drafting and thinking.
They are poor tools for collaborative editorial negotiation.
The idea of a single, permanent “source of truth” breaks down in practice.

## 3. Accepting asymmetry

Writing, editing, and typesetting are different activities.
Authority moves between artefacts depending on the phase.
This movement is not a failure of tools but a feature of real workflows.

## 4. A workable compromise

Write upstream in Markdown.
Submit downstream in DOCX.
Keep formatting rules out of the text itself.
Treat reference documents as explicit formatting contracts.

## 5. A concrete method

A brief introduction to the manuscript-maker workflow:
- Markdown manuscripts as inputs
- Reference DOCX files encoding submission standards
- Disposable generated outputs

(Details live on GitHub; the method is the point, not the mechanics.)

## 6. What this buys you

Calm and reversibility.
Less self-alienation in writing.
Acceptance of institutional reality without surrendering clarity.



# OUTLINE 2

### 1. I thought this would be simple

Why a Markdown → DOCX manuscript workflow seemed straightforward.
What I assumed standards, tools, and formats would already agree on.
Why those assumptions felt reasonable at the outset.

### 2. Where the friction first appeared

Small problems that refused to stay small:
– punctuation
– section breaks
– formatting rules that live outside the text
Each issue solvable in isolation, but revealing in combination.

### 3. Standards as human protocols, not data formats

What the Shunn standard actually is.
Why it works well for people and poorly for automation.
What happens when human conventions are treated as machine rules.

### 4. Tooling that almost agrees

Markdown as a writing surface.
Pandoc as a document compiler.
Word as an editorial environment.
Why each tool is sensible on its own, and why their boundaries don’t line up cleanly.

### 5. The source of truth, after contamination

What remained a single source of truth.
What changed about it.
Why it stopped being cleanly semantic and portable, but stayed authoritative.

### 6. A workable compromise

What the finished workflow looks like.
What lives in Markdown.
What lives in reference documents.
What gets generated and discarded.

### 7. What this buys you (and what it doesn’t)

Stability instead of elegance.
Predictability instead of purity.
A way to work with editorial reality without pretending the tension isn’t there.
