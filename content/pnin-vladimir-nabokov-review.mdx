I'm tempted to say this is the perfect place to start with Nabokov, rather than _Lolita_ or _Pale Fire_, his two most celebrated novels. This is for two reasons. First, there is no troubling subject matter and the main character is harmless and likeable. Second, there is little to no experimental structure to navigate --- what we have, at least on the surface and at least comparatively, is fairly pedestrian: a portrait of a college lecturer in a series of episodes. The result is that we can relax and enjoy Nabokov's amazing prose: the richness and precision of his descriptions, the originality of his metaphors, the weird neologisms, the wordplay, the Gogolian digressions, and last but not least the relative warmth of Nabokov's attitude to the character. 

I'm _tempted_ to say that, but I don't quite endorse it. I don't want to be like those misguided YouTubers with video titles like "Top 10 Sci-Fi Novels for Beginners," which bizarrely assume that said beginners are uninterested in or uncomfortable with difficult prose and challenging ideas (what _I_ would be doing in such a video would be aiming to attract the lovers of adventurous literary fiction who have hitherto dismissed SF as escapist trash). So just as an ostensibly beginner book like _The Martian_ by Andy Weir might actually be a really bad place to start in SF, especially for someone who appreciates good writing, _Pnin_ won't be the perfect place to start for someone who wants an intricate puzzle box of a novel or who relishes moral discomfort and explorations of the self-justifying delusions of guilty men.

And anyway, there is more to _Pnin_ than meets the cursory eye --- than initially met mine, at least.

## Who is Pnin?



## Geographical maximalism

Pnin visits a house in the country where Russian émigrés gather each year, and here Nabokov indulges his talent for extreme geographical precision: 

> From the top platform of an old, seldom used lookout tower --- a 'prospect tower' as it was formerly termed--that stood on a wooded hill eight hundred feet high, called Mount Ettrick, in one of the fairest of New England's fair states, the adventurous summer tourist (Miranda or Mary, Tom or Jim, whose pencilled names were almost obliterated on the balustrade) might observe a vast sea of greenery, composed mainly of maple, beech, tacamahac, and pine. Some five miles west, a slender white church steeple marked the spot where nestled the small town of Onkwedo, once famous for its springs. Three miles north, in a riverside clearing at the foot of a grassy knoll, one could distinguish the gables of an ornate house (variously known as Cook's, Cook's Place, Cook's Castle, or The Pines --- its initial appellation). Along the south side of Mount Ettrick, a state highway continued east after passing through Onkwedo. Numerous dirt roads and foot trails criss-crossed the timbered plain within the triangle of land limited by the somewhat tortuous hypotenuse of a rural paved road that weaved north-east from Onkwedo to The Pines, the long cathetus of the state highway just mentioned, and the short cathetus of a river spanned by a steel bridge near Mount Ettrick and a wooden one near Cook's.

Nabokov said, "Caress the details, the divine details!" And I want to believe that this is great advice, because it intuitively appeals to me, but I have to ask: _why, exactly_? This country house setting doesn't need all that local geographical context; we don't need to know the lie of the land and we don't need to be able to picture it in our minds.

Since we don't really need it, and since the narrator is making stuff up, could it be a signal of the narrator's imaginative self-indulgence?

## Who is the narrator?

From third to first person omniscient.

Who is the narrator and what is his relationship with Pnin? In my first read of this book, I did not pick up on the clues. In fact, though I might have wondered in passing how the narrator could have known everything he claims to know, and perhaps noticed an inconsistency or two in his story, I barely paid attention to this fascinating aspect of the novel, thinking it secondary or casual on the part of Nabokov; I preferred to take the novel as no more than a beautifully written portrait in episodes. But as it turns out, _Pnin_ is something of a puzzle-box after all. 

It comes as a surprise when the narrator begins to insert himself into the story, and the more this happens, the more the story decoheres.

...


So the question is not just, who is the narrator? ***But then who is Pnin after all?*** If he is mostly a creation, a fictionalized (thus doubly fictionalized) version of the real Pnin, then is he mostly just a projection of the narrator? And since the narrator is himself a version of Nabokov, is Pnin a projection of Nabokov?


> When I began writing PNIN, I had before me a definite artistic purpose: to create a character, comic, physically inattractive—grotesque, if you like—but then have him emerge, in juxtaposition to so-called “normal” individuals, as by far the more human, the more important, and, on a moral plane, the more attractive one. Whatever Pnin is, he certainly is least of all a clown. What I am offering you is a character entirely new to literature—a character important and intensely pathetic—and new characters in literature are not born every day.

## Discovery

It's only gradually, with re-reading and the reading of critical commentaries, that the book's depths of oddness opened up for me.
