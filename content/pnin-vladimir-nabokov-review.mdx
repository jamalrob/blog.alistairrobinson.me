I'm tempted to say that this --- rather than _Lolita_ or _Pale Fire_, his two most celebrated novels --- is the perfect place to start with Nabokov. In _Pnin_, there is no troubling subject matter, so we are not constantly wondering about the author's own morality. And there is little to no experimental structure to navigate --- what we have, at least on the surface and at least comparatively, is fairly pedestrian: a portrait of a college lecturer in a series of episodes. The upshot is that we can relax and enjoy Nabokov's amazing prose: the richness and precision of his descriptions, the originality of his metaphors, the weird neologisms, the wordplay, the Gogolian digression (and the squirrels).

I'm _tempted_ to say that, but I don't quite endorse it. It won't be the perfect place to start for everyone. For some, the intricate puzzle box quality of some of Nabokov's books is exactly what they will like. For others, the exploration of the self-justifying delusions of guilty men will be fascinating.

What I can say is that _Pnin_ is one of my favourites.

## Maximalism

The house in the country

> From the top platform of an old, seldom used lookout tower --- a 'prospect tower' as it was formerly termed--that stood on a wooded hill eight hundred feet high, called Mount Ettrick, in one of the fairest of New England's fair states, the adventurous summer tourist (Miranda or Mary, Tom or Jim, whose pencilled names were almost obliterated on the balustrade) might observe a vast sea of greenery, composed mainly of maple, beech, tacamahac, and pine. Some five miles west, a slender white church steeple marked the spot where nestled the small town of Onkwedo, once famous for its springs. Three miles north, in a riverside clearing at the foot of a grassy knoll, one could distinguish the gables of an ornate house (variously known as Cook's, Cook's Place, Cook's Castle, or The Pines --- its initial appellation). Along the south side of Mount Ettrick, a state highway continued east after passing through Onkwedo. Numerous dirt roads and foot trails criss-crossed the timbered plain within the triangle of land limited by the somewhat tortuous hypotenuse of a rural paved road that weaved north-east from Onkwedo to The Pines, the long cathetus of the state highway just mentioned, and the short cathetus of a river spanned by a steel bridge near Mount Ettrick and a wooden one near Cook's.

~ Nabokov always urged writers to describe the setting ~

Nabokov said, "Caress the details, the divine details!" I want to believe that this is great advice, but I have to ask: _why, exactly_? This country house setting doesn't need the local geographical context; we don't need to know the lie of the land. 

And since we don't really need it, so could this be a signal of the narrator's self-indulgence?

## The Narrator

Who is the narrator and what is his relationship to Pnin? In my first read of this book, I did not pick up on the clues; it turns out that _Pnin_ is a puzzle-box after all. 


And so: who, after all, is Pnin?
