I'm tempted to say this is the perfect place to start with Nabokov, rather than _Lolita_ or _Pale Fire_, his two most celebrated novels. First, there is no troubling subject matter and the main character is harmless and likeable. Second, there is little to no experimental structure to navigate --- what we have, at least on the surface and at least comparatively, is fairly pedestrian: a portrait of a college lecturer in a series of episodes. The result is that we can relax and enjoy Nabokov's amazing prose: the richness and precision of his descriptions, the originality of his metaphors, the weird neologisms, the wordplay, the Gogolian digression --- and the squirrels. 

I'm _tempted_ to say that, but I don't quite endorse it. It's like those misguided YouTube videos with titles like "Top 10 Sci-Fi Novels for Beginners," which bizarrely assume that said beginners are uninterested in or uncomfortable with difficult prose and challenging ideas (what _I_ would be doing in such a video would be aiming to attract the lovers of adventurous literary fiction who have hitherto dismissed SF as escapist trash). In other words, _Pnin_ won't be the perfect place to start for everyone. For some, the intricate puzzle box quality of some of Nabokov's books is exactly what they will like. Others might relish the moral discomfort and exploration of the self-justifying delusions of guilty men. And anyway, there is more to _Pnin_ than meets the cursory eye (than initially met mine, at least).

What I can say is that _Pnin_ is one of my favourites.

## Maximalism

The house in the country

> From the top platform of an old, seldom used lookout tower --- a 'prospect tower' as it was formerly termed--that stood on a wooded hill eight hundred feet high, called Mount Ettrick, in one of the fairest of New England's fair states, the adventurous summer tourist (Miranda or Mary, Tom or Jim, whose pencilled names were almost obliterated on the balustrade) might observe a vast sea of greenery, composed mainly of maple, beech, tacamahac, and pine. Some five miles west, a slender white church steeple marked the spot where nestled the small town of Onkwedo, once famous for its springs. Three miles north, in a riverside clearing at the foot of a grassy knoll, one could distinguish the gables of an ornate house (variously known as Cook's, Cook's Place, Cook's Castle, or The Pines --- its initial appellation). Along the south side of Mount Ettrick, a state highway continued east after passing through Onkwedo. Numerous dirt roads and foot trails criss-crossed the timbered plain within the triangle of land limited by the somewhat tortuous hypotenuse of a rural paved road that weaved north-east from Onkwedo to The Pines, the long cathetus of the state highway just mentioned, and the short cathetus of a river spanned by a steel bridge near Mount Ettrick and a wooden one near Cook's.

~ Nabokov always urged writers to describe the setting ~

Nabokov said, "Caress the details, the divine details!" I want to believe that this is great advice, but I have to ask: _why, exactly_? This country house setting doesn't need the local geographical context; we don't need to know the lie of the land. 

~~
Since we don't really need it, and since the narrator is making stuff up, could it be a signal of the narrator's imaginative self-indulgence?

## The Narrator

Who is the narrator and what is his relationship to Pnin? In my first read of this book, I did not pick up on the clues. As it turns out, _Pnin_ is something of a puzzle-box after all. 


And so: who, after all, is Pnin?
