This was published posthumously in 1994, but I think it was written around the time of _Ice_ in 1967, perhaps in the years prior to that. It certainly reads like a rough draft to me. I was expecting something more like a companion piece, but I wouldn't describe it like that. It contains many of the ideas of _Ice_, but they are still only partially realized. As a result, even though I loved _Ice_, I found _Mercury_ tedious. I have not seen anyone emphasize its vast inferiority in reviews, but to me this is the most important point to make about it.

In its undeveloped form, it has some major differences. _Ice_ is in the first person, narrated by "the man," but _Mercury_ is in the third person, alternating points of view between Luz ("the girl" in _Ice_) and Luke (the narrator in _Ice_). This is interesting for two reasons. 

First, we get to know the girl a bit better. Rather than an empty centre and a constructed focus for the man's obsession, we get to read about her fears and motivations. However, I can't say this makes her any more interesting; on the contrary, her lack of assertiveness and her general vagueness of affect are quite irritating, and reduce her from something mysterious and enticing to something mundane.

Second, we get a glimpse of how the unique changes in _Ice_ from first and third person might have developed. I imagine Kavan at some point realizing that by dropping one of the character's points of view and employing primarily the first person instead, she could turn a fairly pedestrian story about two mentally ill people into something much more strange and original, in which the narration drifts insensibly in a way that cannot easily be explained away as dreaming, hallucination, or madness.

There's another thing I found quite interesting, which I don't recall seeing in _Ice_. Luke is sometimes described as a sort of victim himself, resenting and suppressing his own sadistic urges and fantasies. There is a juicy ambiguity here: is he actually such a victim, or is he just a self-centred man feeling sorry for himself?

There are some beautiful passages, such as the opening chapter about the lemurs, and there are moments of well-defined narrative that almost succeed in maintaining interest, but as a whole it is all rather insipid and lacking in drive or passion.

I rolled my eyes when I got to this:

> Her grasp of reality seems to be slipping.

This comes on page 107 of a 136 page book in which reality is constantly slipping for both characters, in which this slippage has been described exhaustively and repeatedly in various ways. We do not need to be told that her grasp of reality is slipping. It's nothing new and you've already told us a hundred times.

Aside from the question of reality, we get constant mention of nameless dread, indescribable horror, vague monstrous presences, and so on, more annoying even than it is in Lovecraft (I don't always agree with "show don't tell" but it applies in this case). Then there's the snow and fog blowing around like "wraiths," and worst of all the constant re-introduction and re-description of the characters in each section, who always start out as "the man," "the traveller," "the girl," etc., but who then finally, _within the section_, go back to being Luke and Luz, before then again starting the next section unnamed.

It's true that some of these things can also be found in _Ice_, but there it just works, because the whole thing feels crafted and more muscular. _Mercury_ is as vague and wraithlike, as weak and irritatingly pathetic, as the characters. While _Ice_ is a dreamlike work of art, _Mercury_ is like being forced to listen to someone actually describe several of their dreams.

I don't blame Kavan for all this; I just think the book shouldn't have been published. It risks putting me off _Ice_ itself.

There are some positives, both internally and in the light it shines on _Ice_. 

Not recommended if you haven't read _Ice_, and even if you have, I'm not sure I'd recommend it. It doesn't really fill any big gaps or answer any big questions, so unless you're a scholar, I wouldn't bother. _Ice_ is a masterpiece and should be left to stand alone.
