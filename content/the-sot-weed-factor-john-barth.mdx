This book doesn't seem to be much talked about today, and knowing that John Barth had a reputation as the original American literary postmodernist, I had come to think it was because it was difficult, more difficult perhaps than the still popular postmodern monster _Gravity's Rainbow_ by Thomas Pynchon. I was a long way off the mark. _The Sot-Weed Factor_ is in fact a hugely enjoyable and brilliant masterpiece, beautifully and transparently written and bursting at the seams with a love of life and storytelling.

The Pynchon book that it most resembles is actually _Mason & Dixon_. Both are based in the early days of Britain's American colonies, concern themselves with the intrigue and culture of the nascent United States, and employ the language of the time --- Late 17th century English in the case of _The Sot-Weed Factor_, 18th century English in the case of _Mason & Dixon_.

But whereas Pynchon's book is a difficult, eclectic, fabulist, hippie stoner retelling of the formation of the early US, Barth's is the smooth, controlled creation of what could almost be a lost 18th century picaresque or Bildungsroman, and a celebration of story for its own sake. There is nothing fantastical --- no talking dogs --- and there is no hint of modern concerns. It reads like Defoe, Fielding, Sterne, and sometimes Cervantes. The plot is endlessly complex and sometimes tiring, but from beginning to end there is always a madcap mishap, an exciting adventure, a glittering insight or a fascinating conversation around the next page. It never lets up, and hardly ever falters or slows down. The characters are appropriately loveable and hateful, the events of their roller-coaster lives always involving and never obscure.

The book differs also from the metafictional postmodern experiments of, say, Italo Calvino in _If on A Winter's Night a Traveller_. Such self-reference and winking to the reader as there is in _The Sot-Weed Factor_ is considerably less than you find in _Don Quixote_ or _Tristram Shandy_.

## Postmodernism

So the postmodernism here, if that's what it is, is a postmodernism "along traditional lines" (to quote from Barth's essay, "The Literature of Exhaustion.") It is a return to the omniscient and reliable narrator and the art of storytelling, at a time when...

> Not only the “omniscient” author of older fiction, but the very idea of the controlling artist, has been condemned as politically reactionary, even fascist. [1]

It might be remarked here that although Barth is not _politically_ reactionary, he is in a way _artistically_ reactionary, since in _The Sot-Weed Factor_ he returns to a discarded form and mode of fiction. This is not a work of the avant-garde or experimental literature.

Isn't it? Surely the return to earlier forms of fiction is itself an experiment? The very fact that Barth knowingly reproduced a long-surpassed form already makes _The Sot-Weed Factor_ some kind of artistic statement, against both the techniques and the psychologism of modernism and also against the conceptual focus of what he refers to as "intermedia".

But basically what puts it in the postmodernist bag is two things. First, it's a total _pastiche_, a fully realized anachronism. Zooming out, Barth's amazing performance reminded me of the Borges story, "Pierre Menard, Author of the Quixote" (as I recall, I made this connection before I realized that Barth had written about it in his essay, but I might be giving myself too much credit). In this story, an author reproduces _Don Quixote_ line for line, but in doing so paradoxically produces something totally different from the original, since it has been produced in a different era and in different circumstances, by a different author with different motivations. It cannot be interpreted in the way that the original is, even though it's identical.

Similarly with _The Sot-Weed Factor_: can we just enjoy it as an early eighteenth century novel? What is it doing there, in the middle of the twentieth century? As Barth himself put it...

> ... art and its forms and techniques live in history and certainly do change.
>
> In any case, to be technically out of date is likely to be a genuine defect: Beethoven’s Sixth Symphony or the Chartres Cathedral if executed today would be merely embarrassing. [2]

What makes _The Sot-Weed Factor_ different? Isn't it precisely the kind of thing he is describing here?

Well, not quite. Unlike _Mason & Dixon_, Barth does not completely reproduce 17th or 18th century English in the _narration_, reserving that for the dialogue and the long quotations from the old journal the protagonists are trying to piece together. Barth wrote it for people like us.

And the thing is, we don't have to think about all that, since it is absorbing and entertaining in its own right. It is a story to immerse yourself in, not (or not only) to analyze. This is the art --- storytelling --- that the writer of fiction is engaged in, and as Cervantes, Sterne and others demonstrated a long time ago, it does not preclude self-reference, formal innovation and playfulness. We don't have to read it primarily as an _important_ novel, or as a call to literary arms, because it's already a perfectly executed romantic adventure, with its own penetrating insights and philosophical meditations on human nature and the ups and downs of life, and with its own themes of identity and innocence. Its greatness is internal, that is, without zooming out --- as I've done above --- to see it as a strange and curious object with an uncertain place in the landscape of literature (but which it also is).

Be that as it may, zooming out again we can see a second mark of the book's postmodernism: the way it weaves fact and fiction in an innovative way. Ebenezer Cooke existed, and Barth weaves a fiction around his most notable work of poetry --- also entitled _The Sot-Weed Factor_ --- and around certain events in his life, but it's impossible to distinguish the two for any reader (which is pretty much _every_ reader) who is not familiar with his life history or with the poem. In the last chapter, the author --- still the notional narrator, although now closer to Barth himself --- says that he expects to be criticized by "a certain stodgy variety of squint-eyed antiquarians" for playing fast and loose with history. His primary reply to this charge is that it's all storytelling anyway; that narratives are contructed for the needs of the narrator in the moment of their creation, thus there is little difference between a chronicle and a fiction. Barth believes that "Fact and Fancy" are not so far apart as we sometimes imagine, and this demonstrates a very postmodern scepticism to some of the underlying intellectual distinctions of modernity, e.g., between fact and value or subjective and objective.

This second postmodern aspect might also go some way to answering the charge that Barth is another Pierre Menard: his blend of biography and fiction is arguably an innovation, thus he is not in fact simply producing a copy or even just a comprehensive pastiche---he manages to sneak in an important innovation without calling attention to it (important because such experiments became more widely used later in the twentieth century, with "autofiction" and "non-fiction novels").

In Barth's essay he describes _The Sot-Weed Factor_ as a work that "imitate[s] the form of the Novel, by an author who imitates the role of Author," and revises his earlier statement about the imagined contemporary poduction of Chartres Cathedral and Beethoven's Sixth:

> I mentioned earlier that if Beethoven’s Sixth were composed today, it would be an embarrassment; but clearly it wouldn’t be, necessarily, if done with ironic intent by a composer quite aware of where we’ve been and where we are. [3]

Barth in general seems to be saying that _The Sot-Weed Factor_ is meant simultaneously as, on the one hand, a brilliantly executed and meaningful work of art; and on the other hand as an intentional intervention in the evolution of literature. The question is how, aside from his stated intentions, we are supposed to know that the book is meant as just such an intervention, or put another way, how do we recognize it as a knowing, ironic pastiche rather than an embarrassing imitation? The answer, I suppose, is precisely the perfection of the performance and the resulting tension of its existence out of time --- which the reader might sometimes forget while absorbed in the story but which he always recognizes at the back of his mind.

## Plot and character

So what is it about? Barth builds his story around a fictionalized version of the 17th-18th century poet Ebenezer Cooke. Barth's Ebenezer is a directionless young man, starting out in London, who seemingly by accident and not through any particular talent finds himself appointed Poet Laureate of Maryland, and proudly takes to the role immediately. Treasuring his virginity, which begins as a mere _incel_ predicament but which he comes to see as the source of his poetic and spiritual energy, he sets of for the New World, with the task --- a somewhat secondary one to him in the beginning --- of taking over and improving his father's tobacco plantation.

Of course, the romantic innocence that leads him to imagine Maryland as a land of milk and honey, an idyllic version of England, eventually crumbles in the face of ugly reality. Cruelty, rape, deception, corruption, and lawlessness are what he finds. Late in the book he has to amend his earlier rosy view of the place following a string of unfortunate events:

>  “What price this laureateship! Here’s naught but scoundrels and perverts, hovels and brothels, corruption and poltroonery! What glory, to be singer of such a sewer!”

But along the way, we grow to love him in the way we grow to love Don Quixote. He can be a fool, and he can get himself and others into hot water, but he means well. And he has his own Sancho Panza too: his down-to-earth and not always reliable manservant Bertrand. Their relationship, their conversations and their misadventures are heavily inspired by Cervantes's famous double-act.

A more complex relationship is that between Ebenezer and Henry Burlingame. Burlingame is irresistibly charming to men and women alike, an endlessly capable man of action and intelligence, but the reader begins to suspect long before Ebenezer does that he might not be the loyal friend he pretends to be.

I don't usually do plot summaries, and I won't attempt one this time, but something has to be said about it, since the novel is first and foremost a story. To summarize, it's pirates, disguises, kidnapping, political intrigue, and convoluted comedies of mistaken identity, sex, and shit. If I have a criticism it's that the political intrigue, often involving characters who are only ever mentioned and never (until the end) appear in person, was difficult to keep a grip on, possibly because I'm ignorant of the history of Maryland and the early United States in general. Francis Nicholson, Lord Baltimore, John Coode and others were real people, but I couldn't easily keep track of who they were and who was against who. In the end it didn't really matter.

Equal in importance to Ebenezer's mission to take the reins at his father's house is Burlingame's mission to discover his provenance. Together, the two of them track down parts of a journal written decades before, which has clues to Burlingame's identity. This story within the story is itself very entertaining, and includes a bawdy retelling of the story of Pocahontas.

I've seen a few reviews that complain about the book's treatment of native Americans and women, but I was actually very impressed that Barth was able to show, through his characters, great sympathy for the suffering of abused women and for the struggles of black slaves and native peoples to assert themselves against the colonizers. It's impressive because he could only push this so far without breaking the spell, that is, ruining the illusion of a lost 18th century romatic adventure story, which depends on contemporaneous stereotypes and most of all on an essential lightness of tone.

One of Barth's rare winks to the reader comes in the very last sentence, where the narrator writes of Ebenezer as the last known literary artist of Dorchester county, where much of the action happens and where Barth himself came from:

> ... either his warning got about or else his complaint that Maryland's air --- in any case, Dorchester's --- ill supports the delicate muse was accurate, for to the best of the Author's knowledge her marches have spawned no other poet since Ebenezer Cooke, Gentleman, Poet and Laureate of the Province.

Highly recommended, and definitely one to re-read.
