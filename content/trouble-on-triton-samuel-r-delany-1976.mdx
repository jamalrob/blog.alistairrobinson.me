_As always: if you're thinking about reading this book, do so before reading this article. TLDR; I liked it a lot._

As far as I can tell, Delany's preferred title for this book was _Trouble on Triton_, but for whatever reason it was published just as _Triton_, and my own Kindle version has that shorter title. I'm going with the longer title, not only because Delany wanted it that way but also because it's better.

The last (and first) Delany I read was _Nova_, which I [reviewed here](/nova-by-samuel-r-delany-1968). That book was written around eight years before _Trouble on Triton_, and the latter's prose is immediately much more impressive and controlled---although it's still pretty odd. The most obvious oddity is the intentional over-use of parentheses. It doesn't feel like an exaggeration to say that every other sentence has parentheses, and this makes for a jarring, constantly interrupted reading experience, similar to reading David Foster Wallace's _Infinite Jest_ with its 388 endnotes. I often had to go back to the beginning of a sentence when I realized I had carelessly charged ahead and over the edge of comprehension.

But that might be the point: to make the reader slow down. Maybe Delaney wants us to pay attention more than we normally would with an SF novel, to take our time over details rather than chasing after the plot as we might be accustomed to doing. As I said in my review of _Nova_, Delaney wants to be literary despite the popular genre trappings.

Put like that, his use of parentheses sounds patronizing, and yet I didn't feel that from the author while reading. So far my impression is of enthusiasm and energy, not self-seriousness or pretentiousness. Self-indulgence, maybe---but that's okay.

Delaney talked about the parentheses in an interview:

> Q: Your style of parentheses in parentheses almost has the same effect. Very daunting. What were you trying to do here?
>
> SRD: That's a different matter. Probably I was trying to say too much at once.
>
> Q: I liked the parentheses. I found that the device really helped me understand the way someone like Bron would think, because he's so defensive and he rationalizes everything. He works a thought through before he thinks of some defensive way of worming his way out of the situation. Or justifying the way he thinks or perceives...
>
> SRD: That's kind of what I was trying for. But I know—simply because I've talked to enough people—that for some readers it doesn't work. The parentheses only get in the way. Well, they do ask a lot of you. Perhaps too much. I write with far fewer parentheses today. But it was my choice at the time—and it may have been the wrong one. Still, some people seem to be able to get with it. When you make a stylistic choice like that, this is the chance you take: some people are just going to find it tedious and balk. Well, they have every right to.

I am one of the readers who can get with it. Interrupting a sentence with parentheses conveys something of what it's like to be thinking all the time, so that the writing achieves a stream of consciousness effect without using the technique traditionally; despite everything it's still a pretty normal third-person narrative. And being in the head of Bron, the main character, makes the reader somewhat complicit in his behaviour. And the thing is, if you're anything like me you're personally primed to identify with Bron, particularly as a not-young and not-old white heterosexual man. The effect of intitially sympathizing or identifying with Bron comes back to bite you later on, as his character is gradually revealed.

Incidentally, maybe you could see Delaney's comment that "probably I was trying to say too much at once," as a key to understanding his work in general. Having only read two of his books, I don't really know, but it describes those two pretty well. However, since I have a lot of time for maximalism, it doesn't really bother me if ideas, references, and images spill out from the pages and overwhelm the plot.

In this case, Delaney has the following things in play:

1. Gender and sexuality
2. Political philosophy and political economy
3. Foucault's concepts of the _heterotopia_ and of the _épistémè_
4. Logic and "metalogic"
5. A fictitious and apparently incredibly elaborate boardgame called Vlet
6. The nature and future evolution of art, particularly theatre

I'll say a few things about the five of those...

## 1. Gender and sexuality



## 2. Politics

It's said all over the place that Delaney wrote _Trouble on Triton_ as a response to Le Guin's _The Dispossessed_.

## 3. Foucault

## 4. Logic and "metalogic"

## 5. Vlet

The game of Vlet first appeared in a short story by Joanna Russ, [A Game of Vlet (PDF)](https://loa-shared.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/static/pdf/Russ-Game-Vlet.pdf).
