_As always: if you're thinking about reading this book, do so before reading this article. TLDR; This is a deeply interesting novel and I read it twice back-to-back._

As far as I can tell, Delany's preferred title for this book was _Trouble on Triton_, but for whatever reason it was published just as _Triton_, and my own Kindle version has that shorter title. I'm going with the longer title, not only because Delany wanted it that way but also because it's better.

The last (and first) Delany I read was _Nova_, which I [reviewed here](/nova-by-samuel-r-delany-1968). That book was written around eight years before _Trouble on Triton_, and the latter's prose is strikingly more impressive and controlled: just as odd, but more obviously deliberate. The most striking oddity is the intentional over-use of parentheses. It doesn't feel like an exaggeration (although it might be) to say that every other sentence has parentheses. This makes for a jarring, constantly interrupted reading experience, similar to reading David Foster Wallace's _Infinite Jest_, with its 388 endnotes. I often had to go back to the beginning of a sentence when I had carelessly charged into a parenthetical section that turned out to be longer or more complex than I expected. A prime example is the very last sentence, which I had to read a few times.

But that might be the point: to make the reader slow down. Maybe Delaney wants us to pay attention more than we normally would with an SF novel, to take our time over details rather than chasing after the plot as we might be accustomed to doing. As I said in my review of _Nova_, Delaney wants to be literary despite the popular genre trappings. Having said that, I'm now more inclined to put a different spin on it: he is trying, not just to be literary, but to critique social conventions and explore alternative ways of living, especially in the arena of sex and gender. It was not so easy to do this openly in fiction back in the sixties, so the speculative nature of science fiction was the perfect medium.

Is his use of parentheses, then, patronizing or didactic? Not at all. So far what I'm getting from Delaney's work is wild enthusiasm and energy, not pretentiousness or polemic.

As it happens, Delaney talked about the parentheses in an interview:

> Q: Your style of parentheses in parentheses almost has the same effect. Very daunting. What were you trying to do here?
>
> SRD: That's a different matter. Probably I was trying to say too much at once.
>
> Q: I liked the parentheses. I found that the device really helped me understand the way someone like Bron would think, because he's so defensive and he rationalizes everything. He works a thought through before he thinks of some defensive way of worming his way out of the situation. Or justifying the way he thinks or perceives...
>
> SRD: That's kind of what I was trying for. But I know—simply because I've talked to enough people—that for some readers it doesn't work. The parentheses only get in the way. Well, they do ask a lot of you. Perhaps too much. I write with far fewer parentheses today. But it was my choice at the time—and it may have been the wrong one. Still, some people seem to be able to get with it. When you make a stylistic choice like that, this is the chance you take: some people are just going to find it tedious and balk. Well, they have every right to.

I admit to sometimes getting annoyed, but on the whole I think I'm one of the readers who can get with it. Interrupting a sentence with parentheses conveys something of what it's like to be thinking all the time, so that the writing achieves a stream of consciousness effect without using the technique traditionally; despite everything it's still a pretty normal third-person narrative. And being in the head of Bron, the main character, makes the reader somewhat complicit in his behaviour. And the thing is, if you're anything like me you're personally primed to identify with Bron, particularly as a not-young and not-old white heterosexual man. The effect of intitially sympathizing or identifying with Bron comes back to bite you later on, as his character is gradually revealed.

Incidentally, maybe we can see Delaney's comment that "probably I was trying to say too much at once," as a key to understanding his work in general. Having only read two of his books, I don't really know, but it describes those two pretty well. However, since I have a lot of time for maximalism, it doesn't really bother me if ideas, references, and images spill out from the pages and overwhelm the plot.

In this case, Delaney has the following things in play:

1. Gender, sexuality, and _épistémè_
2. Political philosophy and political economy
3. Heterotopia
4. Metalogic
5. The game of Vlet
6. Metafiction
7. The nature and future evolution of art, particularly theatre

I'll try to say a few things about most of those. But first, a quick overview: _Trouble on Triton_ is set maybe a couple of hundred years in the future, and it's about a man called Bron Helstrom, an immigrant on Triton and practitioner of _metalogic_ who is vaguely dissatisfied with life. The society on Triton, and in the wider culture of the other populated moons of the solar system, is sexually liberated, but Bron, who comes from Mars, seems to yearn for something else in his life, maybe something more along the lines of a traditional romantic relationship. It is only gradually that we see this develop.

For most of the novel there are rumblings of war ... but the war is very much background in this story.

## 1. Gender, sexuality, and _épistémè_

At the centre of the book is a conflict: not, as in _Nova_, between two men, but between a man and the society he lives in. Bron is unhappy because he thinks differently from everyone else. In a nutshell, he is a dinosaur. Or to put it in terms of the philosopher Foucault---who is quoted in this book and who was, I think, an important inspiration for Delaney---Bron's _épistémè_ and that of Triton society are in conflict, and even incommensurable.

An _épistémè_ is ...

And since he is something of an audience surrogate, our own attitudes are challenged. I imagine this would be even more effective for the more-or-less un-woke readers of science fiction in the sixties.

In saying that Bron is an audience surrogate and that I partly identified with him, I'm sure I'm not speaking for everyone, and it's a risky admission, because the fact is that Bron is a lying, selfish asshole. But he is a lying, selfish asshole in a very recognizable, ordinary way. We all know people like Bron, and certain of us recognize aspects of him in ourselves. 

World-building: progressive moon culture
vs.
Bron: regressive patriarchal culture

There is a surprising amount of comedy in the book, and it all comes from Bron's delusions or his embarrasing behaviour. The dinner-date at the [NAME] restaurant is masterful cringe-comedy.


## 2. Politics

[...] It's said all over the place that _Trouble on Triton_ was written as a response to Ursula Le Guin's _The Dispossessed_, but according to Delaney himself, that's not quite true. He had already finished the first draft when he read _The Dispossessed_, and it was then that he felt that the two books were interestingly in dialogue with each other, so he tweaked a few things and added the subtitle: _An Ambiguous Heterotopia_, corresponding to Le Guin's subtitle, _An Ambiguous Utopia_.¹

Individualist, not collectivist---or the best of both?

But Delaney doesn't want us to think too highly of Triton society. He wants to emphasize that it's not perfect---because _people_ are not perfect, and never will be. He is instinctively postmodern and pluralistic, suspicious of Utopias, grand narratives, one-size-fits-all templates for living, and so on.


## 3. Heterotopia


## 4. Metalogic

Fuzzy logic?
[D. Fox Harrell, "Metalogic, Qualia, and Identity on Neptune’s Great Moon: Meaning and Mathematics in the Works of Joseph A. Goguen and Samuel R. Delany"](https://groups.csail.mit.edu/icelab/sites/default/files/pdf/harrell-metalogic-book-chapter.pdf)

Delaney's fictitious version of metalogic doesn't quite coincide with metalogic as it exists today, _viz._ the study of the properties of formal systems. Maybe we could think of it as the future goal of metalogic as an applied science. Delaney explained the concept in the interview:

> In _Triton_, metalogic, with its mathematical superstructure (the Modular Calculus), is just general, inductive reasoning given a fictive mathematical expression. In Triton it "solves" problems I'm perfectly aware general reasoning can't solve.
>
> Individual metalogics are designed for different situations. The kinds of problems they solve in Triton (always off stage and of a complexity that makes the solution really too hard to follow) are analogous to the following. You're in a room with a door leading to another room. Through the door, someone comes in from the other room, bringing a collection of four or five objects. From a consideration of those four or five objects alone, you now reason out—rigorously and with certainty—what all the remaining objects in the other room must be. Intuitively, we recognize there is no way to find a general solution for such a problem, rigorously and for all cases. The pseudo scientific rationale (in Triton), however, is simply that if we had a mathematical reduction whose mathematics was "strong" enough, we just might be able to come up with a general case solution.

I went from being frustrated at the passages about metalogic, to thinking, as I do now, that they work brilliantly as original world-building. I'm always wary when authors explicitly include philosophy or philosophy-adjacent subjects in their fiction, because it's so often badly done, but Delaney won me over in the end. One of the most interesting ways in which Triton society in the novel is more advanced than ours is in the way that thinking, making decisions, expressing opinions, and so on---mostly informal things today---have either been formalized or have become more thorough, even in everyday conversation.

The woman who Bron becomes infatuated with, called The Spike, alludes to this when they're on Earth:

> A few times, at home, I've met earthies, even become pretty friendly with a few, especially before the war: they always struck me as a little strange. But I racked it up to the fact that they were in a strange and unfamiliar place. I think the oddest thing I’ve noticed, in the two days I’ve been here, is that they’re all so much like all the earthies I’ve known before! They pick up an object, and somehow they never seem to really _touch_ it. They say something, and their words never completely wrap around their ideas. Do you know what I mean?

Notably, earthies are functioning here as a stand-in for humans today. They are intellectually primitive, politically reactionary, and emotionally stunted. The moonies thus represent the Utopianism inherent in Delaney's heterotopia.

Incidentally, the idea that people in a few hundred years might think differently from us is, to me, a basic requirement for good science fiction, but it's quite unusual in the genre (as it is in fantasy too).

Bron himself comes from Mars, which seems to makes him part-way along the progressive scale from Earth to the moons. So he's pretty close to being an earthie in terms of attitudes to sex and gender.


## 5. The Game of Vlet

The game of Vlet first appeared in a short story by Joanna Russ, [A Game of Vlet (PDF)](https://loa-shared.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/static/pdf/Russ-Game-Vlet.pdf).

## 6. Metafiction

As if all of that were not enough, Delaney goes in for some formal tricks as well. The main narrative bulk of the novel is presented as a section entitled, "Some Informal Remarks Toward the Modular Calculus, Part One"; and Appendix B is "Some Informal Remarks Toward the Modular Calculus, Part Two," a fictional report about a lecture series given by the great metalogician Ashima Slade.

If we take this seriously we have to ask how the first-person narrative about Bron Helstrom---who is in many ways unremarkable---functions as "Remarks Toward the Modular Calculus." Obviously we have to indulge Delaney's playfulness here, since it's not credible, but I think it has to go back to Foucault's _épistémè_ [BUT WHAT ABOUT METALOGIC?]. The story of Bron encapsulates

## Conclusion

An odd novel rich with ideas and overflowing with
