**Plato, _Republic_, translated by C. D. C. Reeve, Hackett (2004)**  

This was my second time through the Republic, and I read it as shallowly as I did the first time. Despite a few slow spots, and despite how infuriating it can be, it's something of a page turner, and that kind of reading is not conducive to philosophical reflection. Julia Annas, in her _Introduction to Plato's Republic_, says that the Republic is too famous for its own good; I think it's also too _well written_ for its own good. You can read it like any other dramatic narrative, whereas if you read, say, Aristotle, Kant and Hegel, you are simultaneously _studying_ Aristotle, Kant and Hegel.

But this time I was self-aware enough to see what was happening, so my strategy was:

1. Read the Republic.
2. Read Julia Annas's introduction --- which, more than merely an introduction, is a quite thorough and opinionated analysis --- and other secondary literature.
3. Read the Republic again, while summarizing it in the form of these blog articles, consulting secondary literature as I go.

## Plato or Socrates?

Most of the time I take it for granted that Socrates is Plato's mouthpiece. He is a character, but he is the special character through which Plato demonstrates what doing philosophy is about, and through which he lays out his actual positions on various subjects. What this means is that I might often use "Plato" and "Socrates" interchangeably.

## Terminology

**Justice:** the best translation of Plato's _dikaiosune_, but note: the modern notion of justice involving equality before the law, individual rights, and obedience of the law, is not the notion he was working with. Plato's justice is a _virtue_; it's a matter of personal character, and he is concerned most of all with its impact on the well-being of the community as a whole. And while obeying the law might be required for _dikaiosune_, there's a lot more to it. So Plato's version is more expansive, encompassing all kinds of right conduct in personal interactions that nowadays we might be more likely to think of as a matter of _morality_.

**Morality:** I will be using the term _moral_ quite a lot, not to translate _dikaiosune_ but just because it's relevant to justice as conceived by Plato and his contemporaries. But the morality I'm talking about here is always general: it's about practical reasoning and the right way to live, _not_ about good versus evil or properly moral versus merely prudent acts and reasons --- notions that are alien to Plato.

**Elenchus:** The Socratic method of philosophical investigation, in which Socrates questions someone's beliefs until contradictions emerge. It is really only used in Book 1; thereafter, Socrates's interlocutors don't do much interlocuting and mostly just agree with everything he says. (This makes the Republic a much more dogmatic work than the earlier "What is X?" dialogues, in which the _elenchus_ was the central method).

**Polis**: the city state, which I'll usually just translate as _city_ even though it implies more than that term usually does for us: a _polis_ is basically a small sovereign country comprised of an urban settlement, the surrounding farmlands, and often a port.

## The structure of the Republic

The following breakdown is common in the secondary literature and is not specific to one interpretation. In any case, it's quite clear in the text itself.

![Structure of the Republic](https://ik.imagekit.io/alistairrobinson/blog/plato-republic-structure.jpg?updatedAt=1727282726168)
*Based on [https://www.slideserve.com/Ava/plato-s-republic](https://www.slideserve.com/Ava/plato-s-republic)*

**Book 1**: Dramatic setup and Socratic _elenchus_, eliciting the central questions that the rest of the book will answer: (1) *what is justice?* and (2) *is the just life happier than the unjust life?*

**Books 2-4**: The first part of the main argument. Justice in the city as a model for justice in the individual, thence to the the posit of the ideal city, leading to an answer to question (1).

**Books 5-7**: Answering objections to the practicality and desirability of the ideal city posited in the main argument so far.

**Books 8-9**: The second part of the main argument, answering question (2).

**Book 10**: The banishment of the poets and the Myth of Er. Depending on how you look at it, this book is a crude excrescence or a dumbed-down summary.

## Philosophy as dialogue

Although the Republic is much more dogmatic than Plato's earlier dialogues (where _dogmatic_ here means relating to positive doctrine; offering actual theories and positions rather than just questioning beliefs) it is still framed as a dialogue and kicks off with the elenchus. So even though Plato goes on to tell us at length through Socrates what he really thinks, but still, we often feel like joining in to offer better questions and criticisms than his interlocutors manage, and it is the dialogue form that encourages this. For Plato, dialogue is the basic stuff of philosophy in practice.

On the other hand, a less positive way of seeing this is that for Plato dialogue represents mere belief as opposed to knowledge, such that dialogue is actually inferior, or at least extremely deficient, or alternatively a starting point, from the point of the philosopher. In Book 1 and the earlier dialogues, Socrates is down in the dirt, trying to get deluded and ignorant people to see the light, or to question their own beliefs, whereas what might ultimately be needed is to inspire people with something approaching the truth, which he attempts after Book 1 in the Republic.

And there certainly is a disconnect between Book 1 and the rest of the Republic. This has led some people to suggest that Book 1 was written separately, but to me it's just an admission by Plato that the questions that come up there require a lengthy and expository mode to answer properly.

## Book 1

Before the detail, here's what Book 1 sets out to do: its function is to pose the two central questions that the main argument of the Republic sets out to answer:

(1) What is justice?  
(2) Is the just life happier than the unjust life?

Following the opening dramatic framing, Socrates's elenchus proceeds through various interlocutors until it fails to properly answer the last of these, Thrasymachus, whereupon the two central questions remain up in the air.

Question (1) appears early in Book 1, and question (2) arises by implication from the position of Thrasymachus, who says that justice is that which is in the interests of others; that in fact, it is _injustice_ which is in one's own interest and which thus brings happiness.

### Literary excellence

I'll be focusing mainly on the philosophy, and the arguments, but it is worth looking at the Republic as a work of literature.

It is narrated by Socrates, and he starts by describing the circumstances of the ensuing discussion. This gives us the dramatic frame for the rest of the work, even though it is not referred to again after Book 1.

It is easy to skate over this stuff, but many commentators have seen more in it than is apparent on the surface. Take the very first line:

> I went down to the Piraeus yesterday with Glaucon, the son of Ariston, to say a prayer to the goddess ...
>
> [327a]

According to many interpreters, the idea of going _down_ relates to the important distinction between up and down in the cave allegory and more generally:

|UP|DOWN|
|-----|-----|
|Light|Shadow|
|Reality|Illusion|
|Rational|Irrational|
|Knowledge|Opinion|
|The Good|Qualified goods (contingently good things)|
|Being|Becoming|
|Order|Chaos|
|The eternal|The ephemeral|
|The Forms|Particular instances, and imitations|

**But note:** many of these are connected and overlap, and more importantly, there are gradations between up and down that are made explicit in the Republic, so there is a continuity, not merely a strict dualism.

When Socrates says he went down, he might be implying that he went down among those --- his interlocutors --- who have not attained knowledge and who are imperfectly virtuous. More positively, Plato could be stressing that one _must_ go "down" to ordinary life to see how philosophy can help, that philosophy is not only theoretical but must also be practical. This mirrors the cave allegory, in which those who have seen the light are persuaded to go back down into the cave.

Others have pointed out the significance of having Socrates going to say a prayer to the goddess. Plato was writing in the years following the execution of Socrates in 399 BCE, partly for impiety, something that all his readers would be aware of. Thus Plato introduces an irony to subtly defend Socrates and criticize his sentencing.

My first reaction to these literary interpretations was scepticism, because I had not detected any subtext _at all_. However, I have come around to agreeing. Plato was a sophisticated and careful literary artist, and a really smart guy: there is intention and significance in everything he writes, not least in the framing devices.

Next, in the banter between Polemarchus and Socrates there is some allusion to the Republic's themes:

> POLEMARCHUS: It looks to me, Socrates, as if you two are hurrying to get away to town.  
> 
> SOCRATES: That isn’t a bad guess.  
> 
> POLEMARCHUS: But do you see how many we are?  
> 
> SOCRATES: Certainly.  
> 
> POLEMARCHUS: Well, then, either you must prove yourselves stronger than all these people or you will have to stay here.  
> 
> SOCRATES: Isn’t there another alternative still: that we persuade you that you should let us go?  
> 
> POLEMARCHUS: But could you persuade us, if we won’t listen?  
>
> [327c4]

According Sean McAleer this is a pun on Socrates' name, which contains _cratos_, meaning strength or power. Even so, it alludes to politics and to the theme of persuasion by argument as opposed to force, and rational vs irrational. 

## Cephalus

Cephalus, the head of the household and father of Polemarchus, greets Socrates, and goes on to say:

> I want you to know, you see, that in my case at least, as the other pleasures—the bodily ones—wither away, my appetites for discussions and their pleasures grow stronger.
