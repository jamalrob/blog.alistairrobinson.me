**Plato, _Republic_, translated by C. D. C. Reeve, Hackett (2004)**  

This was my second time through the Republic, and I read it as shallowly as I did the first time. Despite a few slow spots, and despite how infuriating it can be, it's something of a page turner, and that kind of reading is not conducive to philosophical reflection. Julia Annas, in her _Introduction to Plato's Republic_, says that the Republic is too famous for its own good; I think it's also too _well written_ for its own good. You can read it like any other dramatic narrative, whereas if you read, say, Aristotle, Kant and Hegel, you are simultaneously _studying_ Aristotle, Kant and Hegel.

But this time I was self-aware enough to see what was happening, so my strategy was:

1. Read the Republic.
2. Read some secondary literature, primarily Julia Annas's book, which, more than merely an introduction, is a thorough and opinionated analysis based on decades of studying and teaching the Republic.
3. Read the Republic again, while summarizing it in the form of these blog articles, consulting secondary literature as I go.

## Plato or Socrates?

Most of the time I take it for granted that Socrates is Plato's mouthpiece. He is a character, but he is the special character through which Plato demonstrates what doing philosophy is about, and through which he sometimes lays out his actual positions on various subjects, particularly in the Republic. The upshot is that I might often use "Plato" and "Socrates" interchangeably.

## Terminology

**Justice:** the best translation of Plato's _dikaiosune_, but note: the modern notion of justice involving equality before the law, individual rights, and obedience of the law, is not the notion he was working with. Plato's justice is a _virtue_; it's a matter of personal character, and he is concerned most of all with its impact on the well-being of the community as a whole. And while obeying the law might be required for _dikaiosune_, there's a lot more to it. So Plato's version is more expansive, encompassing all kinds of right conduct in personal interactions that nowadays we might be more likely to think of as a matter of _morality_.

**Morality:** I will be using the term _moral_ quite a lot, not to translate _dikaiosune_ in line with Plato's expansive usage but just because it's relevant to justice as conceived by Plato and his contemporaries. But the morality I'm talking about here is always general: it's about practical reasoning and the right way to live, _not_ about good versus evil or properly moral versus merely prudent acts and reasons --- notions that are alien to Plato.

**Elenchus:** The Socratic method of philosophical investigation, in which Socrates questions someone's beliefs until contradictions emerge. It is really only used in Book 1; thereafter, Socrates's interlocutors don't do much interlocuting and mostly just agree with everything he says. (This makes the Republic a much more dogmatic work than the earlier "What is X?" dialogues, in which the _elenchus_ was the central method).

**City**: The _polis_, meaning a city state, which I'll usually just translate as the _city_ even though it implies more than that term usually does for us: a _polis_ is basically a small sovereign country comprised of an urban settlement, the surrounding farmlands, and often a port.

## The structure of the Republic

![Structure of the Republic](https://ik.imagekit.io/alistairrobinson/blog/plato-republic-structure.jpg?updatedAt=1727282726168)
*Based on [https://www.slideserve.com/Ava/plato-s-republic](https://www.slideserve.com/Ava/plato-s-republic)*

**Book 1**: Dramatic setup and Socratic _elenchus_, eliciting the central questions that the rest of the book will answer: (1) *what is justice?* and (2) *is the just life happier than the unjust life?*

**Books 2-4**: The first part of the main argument. Justice in the city as a model for justice in the individual, thence to the the posit of the ideal city, leading to an answer to question (1).

**Books 5-7**: Answering objections to the practicality and desirability of the ideal city posited in the main argument so far.

**Books 8-9**: The second part of the main argument, answering question (2).

**Book 10**: The banishment of the poets and the Myth of Er. Depending on how you look at it, this book is a crude excrescence or a dumbed-down summary.

## Philosophy as dialogue

Although the Republic is much more dogmatic than Plato's earlier dialogues (where _dogmatic_ here means relating to positive doctrine; offering actual theories and positions rather than just questioning beliefs) it is still framed as a dialogue and kicks off with the elenchus. So even though Plato goes on to tell us at length through Socrates what he really thinks, we often feel like joining in to offer better questions and criticisms than his interlocutors manage, and it is the dialogue form that encourages this. This is by design: for Plato, dialogue is the basic stuff of philosophy in practice.

On the other hand, a less positive way of seeing this is that for Plato dialogue exhibits mere belief as opposed to knowledge, such that dialogue is ultimately inferior, or at least an incomplete beginning, from the point of view of the philosopher. Hence his move to the exposition of doctrine. In Book 1 and the earlier dialogues, Socrates is down in the dirt, trying to get deluded and ignorant people to see the light, to question their own beliefs --- whereas what might ultimately be needed is to inspire people with something approaching the truth.

And there certainly is a disconnect between Book 1 and the rest of the Republic. This has led some people to suggest that Book 1 was written separately, but to me it's just an admission by Plato that the questions that come up there require a lengthy and expository mode to answer properly. Dialogue is basic, but some things take a while to explain.

But this apparent disconnect allows us to see that Plato is a subtle, dialectical thinker. The interdependence of opposites --- between dialogue and dogmatism, practical and contemplative, up and down (see below), reality and mere images, seeing the light and returning to the cave --- is dialectical in the modern sense, and Plato is not, or is not _merely_, denigrating one and glorifying the other. I think this is crucial to bear in mind throughout the Republic.

> It is in this dialectic as it is here understood, that is, in the grasping of opposites in their unity or of the positive in the negative, that speculative thought consists.
>
> --- _Hegel, The Science of Logic_

## Book 1

Before the detail, here's what Book 1 sets out to do: its function is to pose the two central questions that the main argument of the Republic sets out to answer:

(1) What is justice?  
(2) Is the just life happier than the unjust life?

Following the opening dramatic framing, Socrates's elenchus proceeds through various interlocutors until it fails to properly answer the last of these, Thrasymachus, whereupon the two central questions remain up in the air, unanswered to anyone's satisfaction.

Question (1) appears early in Book 1, and question (2) arises by implication from the position of Thrasymachus, who says that justice is that which is in the interests of others; that in fact, it is _injustice_ which is in one's own interest and which thus brings happiness.

### Literary excellence

I'll be focusing mainly on the philosophy and the arguments, but it's worth looking at the Republic as a work of literature.

It is narrated by Socrates, and he begins by describing the circumstances of the ensuing discussion. This gives us the dramatic frame for the rest of the work, even though it is not referred to again after Book 1.

It is easy to skate over this stuff, but many commentators have seen more in it than is apparent on the surface. Take the very first line:

> I went down to the Piraeus yesterday with Glaucon, the son of Ariston, to say a prayer to the goddess ...
>
> [327a]

According to many interpreters, the idea of going _down_ relates to the important distinction between up and down in the cave allegory and as a metaphor more generally:

|UP|DOWN|
|-----|-----|
|Light|Shadow|
|Reality|Illusion|
|Rational|Irrational|
|Knowledge|Opinion|
|The Good|Qualified goods (contingently good things)|
|Being|Becoming|
|Order|Chaos|
|The eternal|The ephemeral|
|The Forms|Particular instances, and imitations|

**But note:** many of these are connected and overlap, and more importantly, there are gradations between up and down that are made explicit in the Republic, so there is a continuity, not merely a strict dualism. And my point above about dialectical thinking is obviously relevant here.

When Socrates says he went down, he might be implying that he went down among those --- his interlocutors --- who have not attained knowledge and who are, say, imperfectly virtuous. More positively, Plato could be stressing that one _must_ go "down" to ordinary life to see how philosophy can help, that philosophy is not only theoretical but must also be practical. This mirrors the cave allegory, in which those who have seen the light are persuaded to go back down into the cave and apply their knowledge to ordinary life.

Others have pointed out the significance of having Socrates going to say a prayer to the goddess. Plato was writing in the years following the execution of Socrates in 399 BCE, partly for impiety, something that all his readers would be aware of. Thus Plato introduces an irony to subtly defend Socrates and criticize his sentencing.

My first reaction to these literary interpretations was scepticism, because I had not detected any subtext _at all_. However, I have come around to agreeing. Plato was a sophisticated and careful literary artist, and a really smart guy: there is intention and significance in everything he writes, not least in his frame narratives and first lines (which were as significant then as they remain today).

Next, in the banter between Polemarchus and Socrates there is some allusion to the Republic's themes:

> POLEMARCHUS: It looks to me, Socrates, as if you two are hurrying to get away to town.  
> 
> SOCRATES: That isn’t a bad guess.  
> 
> POLEMARCHUS: But do you see how many we are?  
> 
> SOCRATES: Certainly.  
> 
> POLEMARCHUS: Well, then, either you must prove yourselves stronger than all these people or you will have to stay here.  
> 
> SOCRATES: Isn’t there another alternative still: that we persuade you that you should let us go?  
> 
> POLEMARCHUS: But could you persuade us, if we won’t listen?  
>
> [327c4]

According Sean McAleer this is based on a pun on Socrates' name, which contains _cratos_, meaning strength or power. Even so, it alludes seriously to politics and to the theme of persuasion by argument as opposed to force, and rational vs irrational. 

## Cephalus

Cephalus, the head of the household and father of Polemarchus, greets Socrates warmly, and goes on to say:

> I want you to know, you see, that in my case at least, as the other pleasures—the bodily ones—wither away, my appetites for discussions and their pleasures grow stronger.
>
> [328d]

It's fun to read this as Annas does, as a back-handed compliment which is likely unintentional on Cephalus' part but which Socrates would certainly notice: Cephalus implies that philosophy is for old people with nothing better to do. Plato is beginning his characterization of Cephalus as a wealthy merchant who is moral and just in an unthinking, complacent and conventional way.

That said, Socrates seems quite sympathetic and affectionate. He probably doesn't hold Cephalus in contempt (as some interpreters suggest) but rather sees him as normal, that is, as ordinarily unenlightened, such that he can be used to represent the weakness of common sense, conventional attitudes to justice --- the weakness that allows relativism and nihilism to get a foothold, as represented later on by the sophist Thrasymachus.
