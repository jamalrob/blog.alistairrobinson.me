This is the second book of short stories by Borges that I've read, the first being _Fictions_ a year or two ago. Once again, I took some time to find my feet. One thing I struggle with in Borges is the initially dense exposition of many of the stories, often a frame narrative involving multiple arcane manuscripts and obscure travellers. I actually skipped one of them, _The Other Death_, for this reason. It begins like this:

> About two years ago, I believe it was (I've lost the letter), Gannon wrote me from Gualeguaychu* to announce that he was sending me a translation, perhaps the first to be done into Spanish, of Ralph Waldo Emerson's poem "The Past"; in a postscript he added that Pedro Damian, a man he said he knew I'd remember, had died a few nights earlier of pulmonary congestion. He'd been ravaged by fever, Gannon said, and in his delirium had relived t hat bloody day at Masoller.* The news struck me as predictable and even trite, because at nineteen or twenty Pedro Damian had followed the ban ners of Aparicio Saravia.* The 1904 uprising had caught him unawares on a ranch in Rio Negro or Paysandu*, where he was working as a common la borer; Damian was from Entre Rios, Gualeguay* to be exact, but where his friends went, he went-just as spirited and ignorant a fellow as they were. He fought in the occasional hand-to-hand skirmish and in that last battle; repatriated in 1905, he went back (with humble tenacity) to working in the fields. So far as I am aware, he never left his province again. He spent his last thirty years on quite a solitary little farm a league or two from the Nancay*; it was in that godforsaken place that I spoke with him one evening in 1942 ...

And it goes on like that for quite a bit longer. Apparently the _arresting opening_ was not always a priority for Borges. And just look at all the asterisks!

My brain glazes over when I read this kind of thing. It's not clear what's important, which of these people and places I have to remember, or why Borges is telling me all this. It's an infodump, but an inconvenient one since it's so hard to grasp it, especially with the inherently nested, multiply-ordered nature of the background story---**Person X** wrote me **a letter** to say that he was sending me **a translation** of **book Y** and in **a postscript** said that **person Z** had died since the fever he'd had since **place A** in **year B** ... and so on and on.

But don't get me wrong: I love Borges and this is a great collection. I read all the stories except for _The Other Death_. Here are the ones that stood out:

## The Theologians

I'm a sucker for arcane theological disputes. This one is between Aurelian of Aquileia and John of Pannonia


Our character X is complicit in the execution of Y for heresy on the evidence of Y's refutation and denunciation of an earlier, opposite heresy. In other words, Y was so good at denouncing the first heresy that when the tide of heresy-hunting goes the other way later one, his denunciations are themselves taken as evidence of heresy.

### Heresy 1:

> [H]istory is a circle, and that all things that exist have existed before and will exist again

### Heresy 2:

> [T]he world would end when the number of its possibilities was exhausted; since there can be no repetitions, the righteous are duty-bound to eliminate (commit) the most abominable acts so that those acts will not sully the future and so that the coming of the kingdom of Jesus may be hastened.
