This is the second book of short stories by Borges that I've read, the first being _Fictions_ a year or two ago. Once again, I took some time to find my feet. One thing I struggle with in Borges is the initially dense exposition of many of the stories, often a frame narrative involving multiple arcane manuscripts and obscure travellers. I actually skipped one of them, _The Other Death_, for this reason. It begins like this:

> About two years ago, I believe it was (I've lost the letter), Gannon wrote me from Gualeguaychu* to announce that he was sending me a translation, perhaps the first to be done into Spanish, of Ralph Waldo Emerson's poem "The Past"; in a postscript he added that Pedro Damian, a man he said he knew I'd remember, had died a few nights earlier of pulmonary congestion. He'd been ravaged by fever, Gannon said, and in his delirium had relived t hat bloody day at Masoller.* The news struck me as predictable and even trite, because at nineteen or twenty Pedro Damian had followed the ban ners of Aparicio Saravia.* The 1904 uprising had caught him unawares on a ranch in Rio Negro or Paysandu*, where he was working as a common la borer; Damian was from Entre Rios, Gualeguay* to be exact, but where his friends went, he went-just as spirited and ignorant a fellow as they were. He fought in the occasional hand-to-hand skirmish and in that last battle; repatriated in 1905, he went back (with humble tenacity) to working in the fields. So far as I am aware, he never left his province again. He spent his last thirty years on quite a solitary little farm a league or two from the Nancay*; it was in that godforsaken place that I spoke with him one evening in 1942 ...

And it goes on like that for quite a bit longer. Apparently the _arresting opening_ is not in Borges's arsenal. And just look at all the asterisks! My brain glazes over when I read this kind of thing. It's not clear what's important, which of these people and places I have to remember, or why he is telling me all this. It's an infodump, but a useless one, because it's impossible to grasp it, especially with the inherently nested, multiply-ordered nature of the background story---**Person X** wrote me **a letter** to say that he was sending me **a translation** of **book Y** and in **a postscript** said that **person Z** had died since the fever he'd had since **place A** in **year B** ... and so on and on.

But don't get me wrong: I love Borges and this is a great collection. I read all the other stories; here are the ones that stood out:

## The Theologians

## Story of the Warrior and the Captive

## Emma Zunz

## The House of Asterion

## Deutsches Requiem

## The Zahir

## Averroes's Search
