I read _Tokyo Express_ (previously translated literally as _Points and Lines_), _Point Zero_, and _Inspector Imanishi Investigates_, by Seichō Matsumoto.

Except for Raymond Chandler, I'm not really into crime fiction, so I probably never would have read these books were it not for (a) my habit, when I have the opportunity, of browsing second-hand bookshops, thus exposing myself to happy accidents; and (b) my tendency to judge a book by its cover. I found _Tokyo Express_ in a charity bookshop and was seduced by the beautiful Penguin Modern Classics livery, cover art, and quality typography. (I bought the others as e-books)

What interests me the most about these books is that they are fun [...]

SPOILERS lie ahead. In summary, I think these books are good.

## Tokyo Express

Some say you should avoid any novel that has a map at the beginning. _Tokyo Express_ not only has a map at the beginning, but also has a more detailed map within, as well as two diagrams and various lists and notes. I might have struggled without them --- I was pitifully ignorant of Japan's geography --- but more to the point, they make the book more attractive and intriguing, and they enrich the experience of reading it. The map naysayers are foolish snobs.

_Tokyo Express_, like the other two, is more of a howdunnit than a whodunnit. The stakes are low, and the atmosphere is cosy. All three are compelling page-turners, but they're not manipulative thrillers that make you fear for the protagonist or their loved ones. They're more like puzzles, and you read on because you're so curious about how the crimes were committed. _Tokyo Express_ is the purest of the three: a seemingly impossible crime, the facts of the case and every stage of the investigation laid out clearly and explicitly, the criminal drama relegated to a gradually revealed past --- because the drama that really matters to the reading experience is just the detective's solving of the puzzle.

Trains are prominent in all three novels, but in _Tokyo Express_ they are central to the puzzle. This is a book for train-lovers, more especially the lovers of train _timetables_. It even contains a long quotation from a fictional literary essay about the aesthetic wonder and profound meaningfulness of train timetables. This is not an instance of maximalist self-indulgence (not that there's anything wrong with that) but is actually important to the plot; however, there is more to it than that: one suspects that Matsumoto is sneaking in his own transit psychogeography, a pathos of passage, which perhaps even reveals the backstory of the novel's creation:

> At the very moment that I lie in bed [...] trains are simultaneously coming to a halt all across the country. Countless people are getting on and off them, each following the course of their own life. I close my eyes and imagine these scenes. I am even able to work out, for each line, the stations at which trains are passing each other at that particular moment. This brings me great pleasure. The crossing of the trains is inevitable in time, but the meeting of their passengers in space is entirely accidental. I can fantasize endlessly about the lives led by all these people who, in faraway places, are brushing past each other at this very moment. I derive far more enjoyment from these flights of fancy than from any novel produced by someone else’s imagination. Mine is the solitary, wandering pleasure of dreams.

> Yes --- these days, the railway timetable, with its dense rows of numbers and unfamiliar names, has become my favourite reading material.

The single-minded dedication to the details of railway timetables, which borders on being unhinged or surreal, is part of the pleasure of the novel. 

In common with the other two novels, _Tokyo Express_ is a bit more than a cosy puzzle, and it would be an injustice to apply the label of "humdrum mystery". It's also about corruption and inequality, reflecting Seichō Matsumoto's critical, generally left-wing attitude to the postwar establishment in Japan. The victims are young and innocent --- Sayama, the prime target of the crime, is a government bureaucrat, but his rank is quite low and he seems to be mostly uninvolved in the corruption, such that, to the senior civil servants and ministers, he represents the risk of exposure --- which seems important given the author's alignment with the significantly student-led protests against the U.S.–Japan Security Treaty in the 1950s, when the book was written. But things are not so simple, and it's important to see that Matsumoto is no ideologue. In _Inspector Imanishi Investigates_ he is plainly sceptical about the youthful new intellectual and artistic elite who wish to sweep away all tradition. I'll say more about that below.

[I should say a little something about the plot. ]

I'm not interested in the obvious criticisms of this novel: undeveloped characters, stilted dialogue, a lack of surprises, and low stakes. These deficiencies are actually essential to the kind of book it is and what makes it a great example of this kind. Rather, my criticisms are about the puzzle itself, which is puzzling in a couple of ways.

The first is so glaring a problem that I suspect I missed something and the problem is just my own, in which case I'm not going to call it a plot hole: how could the bad guy know that the couple would get on the train within the four minute interval, since it was going to be waiting at the platform for another 29 minutes? The answer is probably that he instructed them exactly when to arrive --- he masterminded the whole thing, after all --- but I didn't find this explained satisfactorily. Everything else in the novel is explicit --- Matsumoto always makes sure you know exactly where the investigation is up to, sometimes even repeating important information --- so leaving this point implicit is so incongruous that it didn't sit well with me.

The second thing is that the detective's big breakthrough is so obvious that although I had already thought of it, I had dismissed it, doubting my own knowledge of Japan's transport infrastructure in the 1950s. But I turned out to be right: the bad guy went by plane instead of train. That this didn't occur to the police during several weeks of investigation stretches credulity, but I think it's forgivable. In fact, it could even be realistic. Air travel was new at the time, and too expensive for the vast majority of people; it was probably not part of the Japanese consciousness in anything like the way that rail travel was. And tunnel vision is a common human failing: since the perpetrator had planned things so carefully, he succeeded in making the investigation focus on rail travel, and it's natural that it would take the detectives a long time to realize how deep the deception went.

Matsumoto comes across as a likeable, humane author. His sympathies are with the underdogs and the unglamorous.

## Point Zero

_Point Zero_ is different from the other two in that it has a female main character, and one who is not a detective. This is important thematically --- which I'll come to --- but plotwise she functions effectively as a detective. As with the detectives in the other two novels, she is the point of view character, and it is her thoughts that guide us step-by-step towards the truth.

## Inspector Imanishi Investigates

_Inspector Imanishi Investigates_ is a longer and more ambitious novel. I didn't find this entirely convincing, and found myself skipping over paragraphs in an effort to get to the end --- something I associate with the kind of books I avoid, so-called airport thrillers.

But it's not entirely unconvincing either. One aspect os the novel's ambition
