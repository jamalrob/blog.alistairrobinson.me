I read three crime novels by Seichō Matsumoto:

* _Tokyo Express_, previously translated literally as _Points and Lines_ (1958)
* _Point Zero_ (1959)
* _Inspector Imanishi Investigates_ (1961)

Except for Raymond Chandler, I'm not really into crime fiction, so I probably would never have read these books were it not for (a) my habit, when I have the opportunity, of browsing second-hand bookshops, thus exposing myself to happy accidents; and (b) my tendency to judge a book by its cover. I found _Tokyo Express_ in a charity bookshop and was seduced by the beautiful Penguin Modern Classics livery, cover art, and quality typography. (I bought the others as e-books)

What interests me about these books is the way they manage to be light and fun, i.e., _entertaining_, without being trashy pulpy airport novels. The existence of such fiction is overlooked: for many critics --- more the BookTubers than the professionals, it has to be said --- fiction is either deep and meaningful Literature with a capital L, or else it's _mere_ entertainment, an inherently low quality form that one enjoys as a guilty pleasure at best. I've long considered this dichotomy to be false.

SPOILERS lie ahead. In summary, I think these books are good. They are well-written, engrossing, ingenious, and humane. And, for those like me who are unfamiliar with Japanese culture, particularly of the 1950s, they open up a whole new world.

## Tokyo Express

Some say you should avoid any novel with a map at the beginning. _Tokyo Express_ not only has a map at the beginning, but also has a more detailed map within, as well as two diagrams, and various lists and notes representing extracts from the detectives' notebooks. I might have struggled without all this --- I was pitifully ignorant of Japan's geography, for example --- but more to the point, they make the book more attractive and intriguing, and they enrich the experience of reading it. The map naysayers are foolish snobs.

_Tokyo Express_, like the other two, is more of a howdunnit than a whodunnit. The stakes are low, and the atmosphere is cosy. All three are compelling page-turners, but they're not manipulative thrillers that make you fear for the protagonist or their loved ones, or make you expect one thing and then hit you with something else. They're more like puzzles to be solved by the detectives, the reader, and the author together. _Tokyo Express_ is the purest of the three: a seemingly impossible crime, the facts of the case and every stage of the investigation laid out clearly and explicitly, the criminal drama relegated to a gradually revealed past --- because the drama that really matters to the reading experience is just the solving of the puzzle.

Trains are prominent in all three novels, but in _Tokyo Express_ they are central to the puzzle. This is a book for train-lovers, more especially the lovers of train _timetables_. It even contains a long quotation from a fictional literary essay about the aesthetic wonder and profound meaningfulness of train timetables. This is not an instance of maximalist self-indulgence (not that there's anything wrong with that) but is actually important to the plot; however, there is more to it than that: one suspects that Matsumoto is sneaking in his own transit psychogeography, a pathos of passage, which perhaps even reveals the backstory of the novel's creation:

> At the very moment that I lie in bed [...] trains are simultaneously coming to a halt all across the country. Countless people are getting on and off them, each following the course of their own life. I close my eyes and imagine these scenes. I am even able to work out, for each line, the stations at which trains are passing each other at that particular moment. This brings me great pleasure. The crossing of the trains is inevitable in time, but the meeting of their passengers in space is entirely accidental. I can fantasize endlessly about the lives led by all these people who, in faraway places, are brushing past each other at this very moment. I derive far more enjoyment from these flights of fancy than from any novel produced by someone else’s imagination. Mine is the solitary, wandering pleasure of dreams.

> Yes --- these days, the railway timetable, with its dense rows of numbers and unfamiliar names, has become my favourite reading material.

The novel's single-minded dedication to the details of railway timetables, and more generally to the interlocking structures of human action across space and time --- this borders on being unhinged and surreal, but it's part of the pleasure of the novel. 

In common with the other two novels, however, _Tokyo Express_ is a bit more than a cosy abstract puzzle, and it would be an injustice to apply the label of "humdrum mystery". It is rooted in the reality of corruption and inequality, reflecting Seichō Matsumoto's critical, leftish liberal attitude to the postwar establishment in Japan. Sayama, the prime target of the crime, is a government bureaucrat, but his rank is quite low and he seems to be mostly uninvolved in the corruption, such that, to the senior civil servants and ministers, he represents the risk of exposure. Both he and the other victim, a waitress, are young and innocent, which seems important given the author's alignment with the significantly student-led protests against the U.S.–Japan Security Treaty in the 1950s, when the book was written.

But things are not so simple, and Matsumoto is no ideologue. In _Inspector Imanishi Investigates_ he is plainly sceptical about the youthful new intellectual and artistic elite who wish to sweep away all tradition. I'll say more about that below.

I'm not interested in the obvious criticisms of this novel: undeveloped characters, stilted dialogue, a lack of surprises, and low stakes. These deficiencies are actually essential to the kind of book it is and what makes it a great example of this kind. Rather, my criticisms are about the puzzle itself, which is puzzling in a couple of ways it probably wasn't meant to be.

The first is so glaring a problem that I'm pretty sure I just wasn't paying attention, in which case I'm not going to call it a plot hole: how could the bad guy know that the couple would get on the train within the four minute interval, since it was going to be waiting at the platform for another 29 minutes? The answer is probably that he instructed them exactly when to arrive --- he masterminded the whole thing, after all --- but I didn't find this explained satisfactorily. Everything else in the novel is explicit --- Matsumoto always makes sure you know exactly where the investigation is up to, sometimes even repeating important information --- so leaving this point implicit is so incongruous that it didn't sit well with me.

The second problem is that the detective's big breakthrough is too obvious: the bad guy travelled by plane instead of train. I had already thought of this before it was revealed, but because it hadn't occurred to the detectives --- or, apparently, to the author --- I dismissed the idea, doubting my own knowledge of Japan's transport infrastructure in the 1950s.

That it didn't occur to the police during several weeks of investigation stretches credulity, but on reflection I think it's forgivable. In fact, it could even be realistic. Air travel was new at the time, and too expensive for the vast majority of people; it was probably not part of the Japanese consciousness in anything like the way that rail travel was. And tunnel vision is a common human failing: since the perpetrator had planned things so carefully, he succeeded in making the investigation focus on rail travel, and it's natural that it would take the detectives a long time to realize how deep the deception went.

## Point Zero

_Point Zero_ is different from the other two in that it has a female main character, and one who is not a detective. This is important thematically --- which I'll come to --- but plotwise she functions effectively as a detective. As with the detectives in the other two novels, she is the point of view character, and it is her thoughts that guide us step-by-step through the investigation towards the truth.

Matsumoto in all three of these novels has something like a formula. There's (a) a crime-puzzle, interwoven with (b) a context that emphasizes certain aspects of life and society in 1950s Japan. In _Tokyo Express_ the social context is corruption in government, but in _Point Zero_ it's the struggles of women. The main character Teiko is a woman whose new husband --- who she hardly knows, since the marriage was set up in the tradition of _[omiai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miai)_, thus a kind of semi-arranged marriage --- has disappeared. In investigating the disappearance, she uncovers a series of crimes relating to the experiences of those women in the immediate post-war period who hung around with American soldiers and dressed in the Western style. In common with the other novels, then, the book tackles an aspect of the trauma of the Second World War and its aftermath, in which Western and Japanese values and traditions came into conflict. Thus the murderer, a woman desperate to hide her shameful past, is treated very sympathetically.

We are no longer able to feel this as biting or shocking, but one can imagine that in 1950s Japan it was a daring choice of subject-matter, one rarely discussed in respectable circles. Although I said that Matsumoto was no ideologue, he may have been gently radical.

## Inspector Imanishi Investigates

_Inspector Imanishi Investigates_ is longer and more ambitious. I didn't find this entirely convincing, and found myself skipping over paragraphs in an effort to get to the end --- something I associate with the kind of books I avoid, the aforementioned trashy airport thrillers.

But it's not entirely unconvincing either. One aspect of the novel's ambition is the deeper development of the main character. We get to know Imanishi much more than we did with the characters in the other novels. We learn about his habits, his hobbies, and his home life, and we grow to like him. 

It's because he's likeable that I was disappointed when he turned out to be disrespectful and mean-spirited with his wife and sister. This seemed out of character, but probably only because I had conveniently forgotten the taken-for-granted secondary status of women in that society. And it's important to see that we are not necessarily meant to identify completely with him anyway. This is clear from the fact that the author himself doesn't identify with him: Matsumoto has a lot of affection for Imanishi, but there's a distance separating them. Imanishi, though a good detective, is much more unsophistocated, and much more ignorant of and uninterested in science and the arts, than Matsumoto. Whereas Philip Marlowe is a sort of idealized, and in his own way heroic, version of Raymond Chandler, the Imanishi character is a sympathetic study of a certain kind of Japanese man, one very different from the author.

So my point is that Imanishi's patriarchal sexism might be another aspect of this distance between character and author, meaning we can judge Matsumoto as innocent of this charge, and as maintaining his liberal credentials. I'm not just being woke here, but trying to work out how to interpret the book. If in fact Matsumoto does endorse the everyday sexism --- which is quite doubtful given the themes of _Point Zero_, written not long before --- his work remains interesting.

By far the most ambitious formal novelty is the expansion of the point of view. There are chapters in which Imanishi is abandoned and we follow members of the Nouveau Group, a high-profile band of young intellectuals, writers, and artists, eager to play their part in the modernization of Japan. These young men are portrayed mostly as arrogant, spoiled brats, loudly proclaiming their righteousness while mistreating the people around them --- particularly women.

From chapters following the privileged elite, we follow Imanishi as he travels into the poor hinterland, and here Matsumoto presents us with descriptions of poverty that, unlike a lot of the social commentary in these books, still have the power to shock. And whereas _Tokyo Express_ and _Point Zero_ address the occupation and in general the _aftermath_ of the war, _Inspector Imanishi Investigates_ tackles it more directly, describing the firebombing of Tokyo and the upheaval of communities it caused.

Matsumoto weaves these things into the plot, so they are far from forming a mere backdrop to action.

## Conclusion

I liked these books. _Tokyo Express_ might be my favourite, but I can't deny that the later two novels were more affecting, because they complexified the puzzles with social commentary that gave me a deeper appreciation of the various effects on Japanese society of the war and U.S. occupation.

The novels are light and fun, and yet they're simultaneously haunted by the Second World War and the disappearing traditions of old Japan. Recommended.
