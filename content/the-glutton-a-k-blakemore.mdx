I've never referred to a group of starlings as a murmuration, of crows as a murder, or of apes as a shrewdness, and neither have bird-watchers, zoologists, or ecologists. They're cutesy meme-material, and I get particularly irritated by the claim that they're the correct or proper terms to use, just because someone in the fifteenth century, in a fanciful frame of mind, happened to record --- or invent --- the specialist vocabulary of the medieval English aristocratic hunting tradition.

"Did you know that the collective noun for owls is actually _parliament_?"

No, that's not how language works. 

On the other hand, I do defer to convention and talk of a flock of starlings, a school of fish, and a pride of lions, and so, I imagine, do many bird-watchers, zoologists, and ecologists. These are fanciful enough, the difference being that they happened to catch on, and this doesn't support the claim that the more obscure terms are "correct". As far as any word is correct, it's insofar as it is conventional in its field, i.e., standard.

But I've had a partial change of heart. The correctness claim is silly, of course, but I now realize that these terms can be used to good effect. Unlike me, A. K. Blakemore is a poet, not a grumpy old man, so she's open to their individual colours and connotations:

> Black flies rove in thick swarms over this unprecedented feast, **murmurations** almost solid ...

> ... having cast a sceptical look around the dusty **murder** of vagrants gathered in his yard ...

> They fill the sky all around, like a powder, whirling in erratic **murmuration** between the thatch and the rosy firmament.

> He closes his fist around a **murder** of gorged leeches. They stretch like jerky between his teeth and when they burst release a metal flavour, an imbrued juice of diseased blood, on to his tongue, dripping down his chin, the mouthparts crunchy —

What's going on here is metaphor, imagery, sensory and conceptual evocation, not an obedience to a purported law of language (according to the recorded terms of venery from the middle ages, they are misapplied). 

These are just a few examples among many of Blakemore's linguistic inventiveness in her second novel, _The Glutton_.


## Precision and play

> Then there is a darkening and a rumbling among the men and the dancing stops because someone has brought with him a rumour from the south which he heard from a man in Crémieu which he heard from a rider come in from Saint-Hilaire-de-Brens who stopped off at an inn with a crab on its sign at Domarin where there was a meneur in a cat-fur hat who had just come from Nivolas-Vermelle who had it on good authority from a girl he saw in Les Éparres with a wen by her eye whose mother in Doissin had a cousin in Rives that a man came on a big steaming black horse through the river valley of Voreppe, his voice quivering with emotion, saying that he had heard from a porter in Saint-Égrève whose brother in La Tronche had seen with his own eyes that there are soldiers shooting at people in the streets of Grenoble on the orders of some marquis or other, some duke or what-have-you, some cardinal, when he’s at home.

> Vidal says not everything has to be a story. Lozeau says yes, my friend, everything does. Everything is.

> In his mind, he tries to turn his thoughts as though they are stuck on a spit: warming them evenly on every side.



> Antoine murmurs confirmation. He is looking upward now, into the pretty chaos of birds. The red sunlight fills the hollows of his face. You know what else he says? He says that if you watch birds and listen to them, for a long time, you learn why it is they sing and what they sing about, and that they aren’t singing at all, but screaming. They’re screaming at the top of their lungs, _this is my oak tree, my larch_ and _my crust_ and _my eggs_ and _I’ll kill you for them, if I have to, peck your fucking eyes out_. He says that they are not God’s little choir, that they’re nasty motherfuckers, simple greedy motherfuckers, rascals, like the rest of us. Only worse. And if God in a strange caprice made them men for a day and they came tumbling naked from the trees, spitting feathers from their mouths, they would sow such chaos in France as has never been seen. He says that there is no beauty in their song. No divinity in it. They rain down their poison and we smile like fools.


> The jostling of a shoulder at his back brings them closer together until Tarare is stumbled from his feet ...


Like Nabokov:
> So you have come here — the aide-de-camp widens his arms to indicate the conceptual dimensions of his “here” — from a village near to Lyon because you believe in liberty, and in honour, and will proudly shed blood for the patrie?

> undulant hills



> He learned that the pain and starvation of the twenty-five million is contingent. Not ordained by God, at least, but by men. This was news. This was meat for thinking.

But:

> No revolution will reform Tarare. Topple kings and queens right into his open mouth, even, and watch him ask for more.


> Tarare thinks to himself, apropos of nothing, perhaps the world will end in the year eighteen hundred. In eight years, that is. He had heard street preachers in Paris say as much, spittle flecking their reeky beards. He has heard it said and he feels it could very well be so. A nice round number. Eighteen is six and six and six. Eighteen hundred is God’s head rising from a cloudy pillow, God’s two empty eyes gazing down on his strange and perhaps misconceived creation.



Strange repetitions:

> He is a young man, youngish man in his face. A young doctor.


Poignancies and truths:

> ... all my life I have stood at the threshold of my life waiting to be let in ...

> And Tarare weeps. He has no shits to give for any Bourbon or Capet, but still he weeps. Because of time and all it has torn down and robbed from him. The gilt rubbed from the surface of the world. Because of time and all it has borne away, beyond his reach.


Social commentary and condemnation:

> Tarare supposes it is true what the radicals say of the aristocracy—that all the sugared edifices of Old France were built on nothing but accidents, smoke and mirrors. Who feasts and who starves, entirely a matter of chance—chance then reified and made sacred, made other than it is, through God and debt andmachines. And whips.

> He thought of war, and what even he, in his extremely limited experience, had seen it do to bodies: gathering them together,winnowing them small, flaying them open, bashing them against each other.

> It drifted laterally, to hills velveted with dwarf pine. It drifted up to the clement afternoon sky, threaded with vectors of slender cloud, where birds lived their small-time birdlives. It drifted down to settle in the grass, then dug in further, down down, to where good black dirt cradles the bones of other boys who went to war, and their mothers, and their pet dogs, and their beautiful horses (and the boys who killed them, too, and the kings they fought for, and their beautiful horses too). Dig a hole anywhere and find them grinning up at you indifferently. I am sick of this, Tarare thought. Let it end.

(these are Tarare's thoughts, and we're on his side)

[We are often on Tarare's side, but we cannot overcome his monstrousness entirely, so we get Sister Perpetue and Citizen-Doctor Dupuis as alternative audience surrogates]

Meta:

> These are not the words that Tarare uses to think about it, but this is what he thinks


Protestants:

> They think he is a heretic, do they? And so? Perhaps _they_ are the heretics. Denuding and drabbing his fabulous God, making a bumpkin of him.


Insightful and precise physical and natural description

> Fine yellow hair resolved to softest white ash.

> imperceptible predations


Ideas:

> Everyone looks like something, Tarare thinks. Nobody looks like nothing. God loves to plagiarise himself. Pig, mole-rat, fox cub, peach stone.



How he becomes the mocking cynic: 1. torture by the Prussians, 2. eating the child. All innocence lost.

> But what happened to him in the forest was certainly not. It has whittled him out on the inside. He feels it in himself, in as much as a person can feel a void. It is like a tingling of his heart and mind where delight or care once were. A phantom soul.

> Tarare, says Doctor Dupuis. Where are you going?
> To Hell, replies Tarare, his eyes fixed on the horizon.
