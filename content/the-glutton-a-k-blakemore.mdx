I've never referred to a group of starlings as a murmuration, of crows as a murder, or of apes as a shrewdness, and neither have bird-watchers, zoologists, or ecologists. These terms are material for cutesy memes, but what's worse is the claim that they're the correct or proper ones to use, just because someone in the fifteenth century, in a fanciful frame of mind, happened to systematically record --- or invent --- a specialist vocabulary supposedly used in the medieval hunting tradition of the English nobility.

"Did you know that the collective noun for owls is actually _parliament_?"

No, that's not how language works. 

On the other hand, I do defer to convention and talk of a flock of starlings, a school of fish, and a pride of lions, and so, I imagine, do many bird-watchers, zoologists, and ecologists. These are fanciful enough, the difference being that they happened to catch on. This doesn't support the claim that the more obscure curiosities, like _parliament_ or _shrewdness_, are correct. As far as any word use is correct, it's insofar as it is in line with the conventions of its field.

But I've had a partial change of heart. The correctness claim is silly, of course, but I now realize that these terms can be used to good effect. Unlike me, A. K. Blakemore is a poet, not a grumpy old man, so she's open to their individual colours and connotations:

> Black flies rove in thick swarms over this unprecedented feast, **murmurations** almost solid ...

> ... having cast a sceptical look around the dusty **murder** of vagrants gathered in his yard ...

> They fill the sky all around, like a powder, whirling in erratic **murmuration** between the thatch and the rosy firmament.

> He closes his fist around a **murder** of gorged leeches. They stretch like jerky between his teeth and when they burst release a metal flavour, an imbrued juice of diseased blood, on to his tongue, dripping down his chin, the mouthparts crunchy —

This is obviously not obedience to correct terminology --- according to the recorded "terms of venery" from the middle ages, Blakemore has misapplied them. Rather, it's sensory and conceptual evocation, nodding to the terms' current popularity as linguistic curios but using them how she likes.

These are just a few examples among many of Blakemore's linguistic inventiveness in her second novel, _The Glutton_. At its heart it's a powerful work of historical fiction, but while it's not experimental in any essential way, her use of metaphor, imagery, and obscure vocabulary, along with flashes of magic and horror --- this all works to make it into something quite weird and uncanny.

But unlike a lot of "weird fiction," the language is more often precise than fey. Its observational precision reminded me of Nabokov even before I found out that she was a fan, such as here:

> So you have come here — the aide-de-camp widens his arms to indicate the conceptual dimensions of his “here” — from a village near to Lyon because you believe in liberty, and in honour, and will proudly shed blood for the patrie?

## Tarare

The novel is a fictionalization of the life of the famous Tarare (sometimes Tarrare), who lived and died in revolutionary France and who was known for his insatiable appetite and the ability to eat vast amounts of just about anything. It is structured by a frame narrative in which dying Tarare, isolated and shackled to a bed in hospital at Versailles, tells the story of his life to Sister Perpetué, a young nurse and nun tasked with the job of watching over him. Having heard the horrifying rumours, she sees Tarare initially as a kind of monster, but quickly becomes engrossed in his story, as we do too.

The tale he tells begins with his birth and takes us up to his arrival at Versailles. It's a sort of picaresque adventure about his journey from a peasant village near Lyon all the way to Paris, while the chaos of revolution spreads. 

In Blakemore's fictionalization, we spend a lot of time in Tarare's head, and we get to know him. From a young age he is curious, sensitive, and open-hearted, and even before the brutal beating that produces his hyperphagia, we feel for him, an odd but innocent child in a cynical, brutal world. 


## Revolution

Blakemore, like Tarare himself, is ambivalent about the French Revolution. The world of the novel is passionate, certainly not *com*passionate. While we are confronted with the injustices of the old system, we are also made to face up to the mad horrors unleashed in its destruction. 

Whatever Tarare might think about it all, and whatever he might want to do about it, he is always excluded. He has an awakening class-consciousness:

> He learned that the pain and starvation of the twenty-five million is contingent. Not ordained by God, at least, but by men. This was news. This was meat for thinking.

But due to his condition, he cannot properly engage in either thought or action:

> No revolution will reform Tarare. Topple kings and queens right into his open mouth, even, and watch him ask for more.

Over the course of the story he is beaten, abused, manipulated and exploited, and he seems to be fated to it. Even Lozeau, one of the more likeable characters, brings Tarare into his group of vagabond misfits mainly just to use as a freak to show at festivals and fairs for money. And the doctor Dupuis, the first person in the unfortunate young man's life to show him genuine concern, gradually grows to hate Tarare for the outrage of his very existence --- not despite but because of his suffering.

It's left to Blakemore to redress the wrongs that were done to him.


## Tragically queasy

I had a unique experience in reading this novel. I felt some sort of emotional queasiness, and sometimes wanted to look away, to put the book down and not pick it up again. But it wasn't the disgusting descriptions of Tarare's feeding frenzies or even the acts of cruelty and violence. Rather, it was the knowledge that Tarare would be painfully hungry for the whole of the book and the whole of his life. The tragedy was not in the background, waiting to bring down the hero at an unexpected moment. His tragic hunger is, for Tarare and for the reader, impossible to forget. 

So in the novel's first half I could never quite relax and enjoy it. I could never settle into the flow of the story as I usually would with a picaresque adventure. Looking back, this is one of the novel's strengths, so long as you can take the discomfort. And oddly enough, although things get a lot worse for Tarare in the second half of the novel, by that point you're hooked.


## Is it experimental?

I said before that the novel is not essentially experimental, but maybe I'm wrong. The thoughts of Tarare _are_ essential, and they are rendered with an artistry and sophistication that is quite incongruous for an illiterate peasant. And Blakemore even signals this to the reader in a kind of aside:

> These are not the words that Tarare uses to think about it, but this is what he thinks.

Here the omniscient storyteller finally admits, a long way into the novel, that her version of Tarare's thoughts, while not quite a fiction, is at least an artifice.

What are we to make of this? In the normal run of things, omniscient third person narration is about the events and characters of the story, maintaining the pretence of Olympian knowledge --- but it can occasionally break self-consciously into a direct address to the reader. Thus we have at least two possible levels or registers, with nothing in between: (a) about the events and characters within the story, and (b) about the story itself (and in metafiction, about the storytelling). But Blakemore in this case seems to have found a level in between: she cannot know, as she claims to know, what Tarare's thoughts were, and while this is just how omniscient narration works, something we are very used to, at the same time she explicitly draws our attention to this artifice, breaking the suspension of disbelief. And this only adds to the mystery, adding a new level of artifice, since it seems to imply that the narrator really _has_ read the mind of this strange man of the 18th century, but has chosen to render its thoughts differently. 

And the artifice is not only in the imagining of Tarare's thoughts, but also in the telling of his story: I referred above to "the tale he tells," but we do not get to read his words, to hear his tale directly. Blakemore instead fashions it in her own words from an Olympian viewpoint --- or view from nowhere --- dispensing with his own first-person account.

At every level, we not only feel, but _feel that we are being made to feel_, the presence of the narrator and author shaping the story to produce certain desired responses, such as sympathy, disgust, anger, and so on. And despite this artifice, we do respond in those ways.

On the other hand, maybe all this trickery, combined with the shifting points of view, serves to emphasize Tarare's isolation and basic, irremediable exclusion from the world. We are often on Tarare's side, seeing the world from his point of view, but we cannot overcome his monstrousness entirely, so we need the additional points of view of Sister Perpetué and Doctor Dupuis to bring us back to normality, or to humanity, and to allow us to see him as the wretched monster he partly is. 

I don't really know if Blakemore is doing literary experimentation or if it's more like a normalized postmodernism (i.e., this is just how we write mainstream novels now). In any case, Blakemore seems to maintain, along with postmodern John Barth, that it's stories all the way down, as one of her characters states:

> Vidal says not everything has to be a story. Lozeau says yes, my friend, everything does. Everything is.


## Is Tarare incoherent?

Some readers have complained that the Tarare depicted in the frame narrative doesn't feel like the inner Tarare of the central story. I certainly felt this incongruity as well: in the inner story, even after the onset of his hyperphagia, he is naive, loving, and hopeful; but in the frame narrative, as he talks to Sister Perpetué, he is mocking and cynical. For most of the novel, these two Tarares cannot be reconciled, but I think this is pretty much resolved towards the end, when Tarare is finally broken, his loss of innocence complete. I won't give away what happens, but I'll quote its aftermath:

> He walks and he doesn’t stop walking when he becomes aware of the rider approaching on his left-hand. The shadow of the horse cools the side of his sunburnt face.
>
> Tarare, says Doctor Dupuis. Where are you going?
>
> To Hell, replies Tarare, his eyes fixed on the horizon.

## Conclusion

I expect to read _The Glutton_ again. Despite the discomfort, it has an addictive storytelling energy and it keeps you on your toes with startling word choices, poetic dissonances, stylistic detours, arresting images and beautiful observations.

I highlighted dozens of sentences and passages when I was reading, but I'll just pick a couple. I loved this description of Protestantism from the Catholic perspective, when Tarare makes the mistake of crossing himself when he shares a meal with a family of German country folk:

> They think he is a heretic, do they? And so? Perhaps _they_ are the heretics. Denuding and drabbing his fabulous God, making a bumpkin of him.

There is one insight that really stood out for me, because I've been occasionally preoccupied with the question for years. In my twenties and thirties I began to wonder why the recollection of earlier events in my life made me sad, even if those events had been happy. It took me a long time to understand what might seem obvious to many people, namely that I was grieving for the irrecoverable loss of the past. Blakemore puts it like this:

> And Tarare weeps. He has no shits to give for any Bourbon or Capet, but still he weeps. Because of time and all it has torn down and robbed from him. The gilt rubbed from the surface of the world. Because of time and all it has borne away, beyond his reach.

Recommended.
