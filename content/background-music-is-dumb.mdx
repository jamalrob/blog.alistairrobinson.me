> Videos like that are part of the problem, in my opinion. Even aside from the surface-level analysis, notice the constant background music, a distinctive feature of the products of the attention-economy. The point of background music is (a) to smooth everything out into an easily digestible paste, like baby food, (b) to give you a dramatic or portentous or serious or peaceful atmosphere in place of analysis and argument. The result is featureless and frictionless, lacking any ability to make you think again.
