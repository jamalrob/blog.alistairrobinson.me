I read a few stories by Poe in my twenties, but never really delved into his work, so I'm reading a selection of his stories now. I just read "The Unparalleled Adventure of One Hans Pfaall" and really enjoyed it, not particularly because of its literary merit, but because it has a weird quality that I've been trying to put my finger on.

It purports to be about Hans Pfaall, a "mender of bellows" in Rotterdam who suffers poverty when demand for his services completely dries up (which he somehow blames on political radicalism). Hounded by his creditors, he decides to kill himself, but on discovering some books on "Speculative Astronomy" and mechanics, he decides instead to escape his debts by building a balloon and travelling to the moon (incidentally, this is _exactly_ my kind of thing). Later we find out that Pfaall has in all likelihood been hanging out with his cronies for the last five years, sailing around the world and getting drunk. The story of the moon voyage, received by letter directly from a resident of the moon, was an elaborate scheme to fake his own disappearance.

On top of that, Poe's story was apparently written as a hoax. This is hard to believe now, since the story is so incredible and obviously comedic, and my resulting confusion is part of what I'm trying to work out here.

I saw a Goodreads review that included this comment:

> I'm blown away by how many modern concepts are in this 19th century story.

My feeling is the opposite: I'm blown away by how outdated the story is. And for me, it's this quality that makes it so fascinating and charming. Science fiction progressed beyond this stuff more than a century ago. Where can we find, today, stories about balloon rides to the moon and diminutive extra-terrestrial men who wear "sky-blue satin, with tight breeches to match, fastened with silver buckles at the knees." Certainly not in science fiction. There is obviously something intentionally comic about it, but for me there is something weird and unnerving as well. It has some touches of horror: the description of the hero's physical distress on his way out of the atmosphere is quite gruesome, and on the dark side of the moon there are "dark and hideous mysteries."

But it's more than that. It feels like a glimpse into a lost world, and it was quite hard for me as a reader to get my bearings. What is the balance between serious scientific speculation and satire, or between scientific romance and pure comedy---or between thriller and hoax? I can't quite tell, and that's what makes it remarkable. Poe spends interminable paragraphs on scientific description which is ultimately boring and unclear---do these passages reflect Poe's genuine interests or is he satirizing something? He cannot be satirizing Verne, since the direction of influence was from this story to Verne. Explicitly, the satire is targeted at "speculative astronomers," those who would speculate about men on the moon and so on. But this wouldn't justify the pains to which Poe goes in order to make the balloon journey seem scientifically explicable. Even if it's not the very first science fiction story, it might be the first _hard_ science fiction story.

And I like it because of what it lets us see: the attitudes and the state of knowledge of Poe's contemporary society; the state of _literature_ at the time; and the origin of modern science fiction. It's a curiosity of the best kind, and aside from the boring bits, very enjoyable.
