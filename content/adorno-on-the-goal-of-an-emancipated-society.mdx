Since I was young I have allied myself with the Left, believing that human beings ought to live free of economic or administrative compulsion and domination. When asked about the goal of such an emancipated society, I talk of such things as the _fulfilment of human posibilities_, the _richness of life_, and _the equal and unrestricted opportunity of all people to pursue their creativity_. According to Adorno, not only are these ideas not radical enough but they positively reproduce the worst imperatives of capitalist society:

> _Sur L'Eau._ — He who asks what is the goal of an emancipated society is given answers such as the **fulfilment of human possibilities** or the **richness of life**. Just as the inevitable question is illegitimate, so the repellent assurance of the answer is inevitable [...] There is tenderness only in the coarsest demand: that no-one shall go hungry any more. Every other seeks to apply to a condition that ought to be determined by human needs, a mode of human conduct adapted to production as an end in itself. Into the wishful image of an uninhibited, vital, creative man has seeped the very fetishism of commodities which in bourgeois society brings with it inhibition, impotence, the sterility of the never-changing.

Can I withstand this criticism? Do I want to? Is Adorno calling me repellent? Whichever way I go, I appreciate the challenge. Adorno always thinks deeper and with more originality, and with closer _attention_, than anyone else. It's good to be shown where one has failed to think things through.

First, what is he actually saying? In a nutshell, it's that everything beyond the basic demand that nobody shall go hungry applies only to the conditions of its genesis, in particular, to the society in which production is an end in itself. Thus, the fulfilment of human possibilities and the richness of life are bourgeois concepts which can only express the conditions of capitalist production and exchange, of variable value, success and failure, and of means and ends where the ends are unquestioned. Adorno might ask, why must the human being _realize_ its possibilities, like a company realizing the value of a raw material via processing? Why must life be _rich_, like a consumer's life is rich with a diverse choice of new and exciting products?

And we should stop to notice his point that not only these answers but the question itself is illegitimate: asking what the goal of an emancipated society is to miss that the emancipation of society does not need to justify itself, and if you think it does, you are asking for its _utility_, expressing the means-ends reasoning characteristic of modernity. It is asking the slave what the point of escaping is, forgetting that freedom is an end in itself.

Thus we have two incommensurable attitudes confronting each other: on one side, production and profit are ends in themselves; on the other, _emancipation_ is an end in itself. But they are not quite equal: in conditions where the former attitude is dominant, the question will be asked as to _how the latter serves as means to the former end._

He makes the point that the _uninhibited, vital, and creative_, expressed through the lens of capitalism, leads to _inhibition, impotence, and sterility_, and it is on this latter pole that we find fulfilment, richness, and so on. This seems to imply that the _uninhibited, vital, and creative_ are pure, transcendent, truly human. But couldn't I turn the tables and accuse him, with his appeal to creativity, of _also_ importing the imperatives of production? Are _fulfilment_ and _richness_ any more contaminated by capitalism than this? After all, capitalism, like no other economic system before it, advances by "creative destruction." It produces novel, world-changing products every few years or decades. Can we really separate out creativity from its meaning in capitalist society? Can we be sure that its aura, its positive normative valency, does not derive from the capitalist ethos of perpetual innovation?

In any case, the idea that the _uninhibited, vital, and creative_ are pure and transcendent is questionable, and very un-Adornian. Can he really be saying that _his_ concepts are about pure human need, but _our_ concepts of fulfilment and richness are tainted?

Surely that would be un-self-aware, and Adorno is nothing if he is not self-aware. So how are we to undertand him?

The point is not that the uninhibited, the vital, and the creative are needs or imperatives that transcend society and history, but rather that bourgeois society has produced those ideals while at the same time deforming them, failing to see them through. Liberal capitalism's own ideals are curtailed by its imperatives of money and power. 

Even so, this does still seem to imply that his concepts are closer to true human need than mine. That seems debatable to me, at the very least.

Of course, it doesn't really matter, and we can agree with Adorno in spirit if not in his details. Adorno's ultimate position is that we should assert human need, _whatever that need is or might become_. We can say that everyone should have enough food, water, and shelter, but — even though we know human life can be much more than this — if we say any more, we shackle our hopes to mere possibility, where possibility, as something that can grow from what already exists, always contaminates our hopes with the status quo.
