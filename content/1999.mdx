**DISPATCH TO THE HOLY CUSTODIAN, BARACHIEL**  
**ON THE FEAST OF THE PROCESSION OF THE HOLY CROSS**
**IN THE YEAR OF OUR LORD 1999**  
**SECOND CYCLE**  

---

Further to our reports concerning the disappearances of Russian nationals in the vicinity of the Consulate of the Russian Federation, Glasgow, we present here a supporting narrative distillation based on our own supervisory oversight, specifically regarding the case of Zhigulevsky. We ask that any prideful exercise of poetic license herein be met with the esteemed recipient's gracious understanding.

For context we shall interpolate several excerpts from the record of conversations between the two Observers who worked on the case. This might additionally shed some light on the operation's failures and more generally on the privation of monastic decorum and commitment in the divisions of the Brotherhoods responsible for expatriate affairs.

§ § §

_BROTHER OBSERVER MAKARIOS: Where is Father Georgy? Wasn't he supposed to meet Zhigulevsky and get him to the church safely?_  

_FATHER OBSERVER THEOPHANES: Be quiet please, Brother. I'm seeing a disturbance, and our Zhigulevsky is heading straight for it._

_MAKARIOS: I can't see anything._

_THEOPHANES: What a surprise._

_MAKARIOS: I just think I'd be able to do a better job if I knew what was going on. Did you send that update yesterday?_

_THEOPHANES: Your dedication is an inspiration to us all, Brother._

_MAKARIOS: Respectfully Father, what I am wanting is a straight answer._  

_THEOPHANES: Oh, you are wanting all right. Wanting in patience, for one thing._  

_MAKARIOS: You don't have to put up with me, you know. I would be happy, blissfully so in fact, to ask for reassignment. I want very much to get on with the job._  

_THEOPHANES: Again, you want. Want want want want want._  

_MAKARIOS: Respectfully Father, might I ask if you are quite secure in your understanding of the concept of mentorship? From whom can I learn but you?_  

_THEOPHANES: Permit me to suggest a mutually beneficial arrangement. I shall impart to you with good grace the secrets of the Brotherhood, and you shall, one: endeavour to conceal your spectacular talent for irksomeness; and two: adorn your endless Respectfully Fathers with some actual respect._  

_MAKARIOS: Seems reasonable._  

_THEOPHANES: Now, kindly keep your eyes to your Soulglass and allow me to do likewise._

_MAKARIOS: Thank you, Father. Your generosity of spirit stirs me beyond words._

§ § §

And here he is: Zhigulevsky, wandering in quiet business district streets. It is getting close to the close of the twentieth century. It is mostly empty buildings and empty corner cafés, all closed, because it is Sunday in the business district. It has been hot and dry like this for many days, and the as-yet unswept and unhosed working week's dust rises and falls with the tabloid pages and bus tickets in the street-funneled breezes, golden where caught in chinks of sunlight admitted by gaps up high.

But look: here is an anomalous shop, anomalously open for business, its door wide open to the street. A skateshop, selling skateboards, parts, and accessories --- a natural configuration. A shop, then, which is anomalous in context but is in itself coherent, thus resting within the order appointed by Christ Himself.

And listen: they are playing fast aggressive rock music, which echoes off the street's high walls of polished stone cladding and glass, the sound's waves unscattered by traffic and undamped by pedestrians. Zhigulevsky, buffeted by them, his memory in turn nudged awake by this buffeting, now remembers the scrap of paper in his shorts pocket, and is no longer wandering. With singular purpose, he enters.

Meet the two men within: Anderson and Sawyer. Sawyer, a young man on the customer side of the counter, is sawing to the rhythm of the music through a short thick plank of timber, which is clamped to the counter. Anderson, a moderately older man on the staff side of the counter who has been grinning and watching Sawyer, watches Sawyer again and grins again after having glanced at Zhigulevsky ungrinningly.

What neither Zhigulevsky nor our Observers will discover is that there is also a young woman in the shop, browsing among the wheels. She is dressed unseasonally in an overcoat several sizes too big for her slight frame. She stares at Zhigulevsky from behind a display, as alert and furtive as a weasel. 

Anderson turns off the music, and Sawyer stops sawing.

"Lost?" says Anderson.

"Good day. You are very perceptive."  

"Well, you're no skater."  

"I want to know where is this address. I know it is near the Russian Consulate, but I do not know where that is."  

He shows the scrap of paper to Anderson, who reads and frowns, reads and frowns, shakes his head and shakes his head and passes it to Sawyer, who reads it and nods.

"It's hard to get to."  

"Perhaps you can write down the directions."  

"Nah, I'd have to show you. I'm going that way in a minute, but I'll be on my board."  

"I could run."  

"In flip-flops? I don't think so."  

Anderson says hold on, goes to another room, and returns with an old skateboard.

"You can borrow this. The deck's seen better days, but the rest is solid."  
  
"You are very kind, but only if you are certain."  
  
"It's got low trucks so it's nice and stable."  
  
"That is ideal, as I am a novice."  
  
"You want a helmet? Pads?"  
  
"No, I will take the risks."  
  
"Have it back by five thirty. Shred it bro."  

Anderson laughs, and Sawyer laughs too while he gathers up the plank of wood, the saw, and the clamp, puts them in a backpack, and grabs his board.

Out on the street, they mount the boards and head West.

§ § §

_THEOPHANES: He's moving faster now, so you have to continuously refocus. That's it, you're doing quite well. About time._

_MAKARIOS: Entirely owing to your solicitous guidance, Father. Anyway, look. He's heading West._  

_THEOPHANES: Into a bright future, I hope. The zone of disturbance hasn't followed them, which means this skateboard fellow is harmless._  

_MAKARIOS: Must have been the other guy. Better send an update._  

_THEOPHANES: Oh, Makarios, what am I to do with you? Consider that spiritual disturbances emanate from places and things as much as from people, that there might have been other people in the back rooms of the shop, and that there are dozens of floors above the shop, containing who knows how many people._

_MAKARIOS: It's just empty offices._

_THEOPHANES: It is worse than merely impertinent for a servant of the Lord to lay claim to omniscience. We do not know that the offices are entirely empty. My point stands: certainty remains elusive. Zhigulevsky is by no means out of the woods yet. Once he's in the church, we can relax for a while._
  
§ § §

The surface is smooth, but Zhigulevsky has never been on a skateboard and struggles to keep up and stay on. He is going as fast as he can, but Sawyer continues to recede into the distance ahead.

The business district comes to an end at the edge of a wide urbanized ravine. Although the ground drops away, and the road curves down on stilts into the sprawling highway interchange that occupies the depths below, Zhigulevsky heads for Heaven. For Sawyer has just crested a shallowly parabolic reinforced concrete footbridge, which elegantly traverses the great gap with the help of only two slender piers.

Zhigulevsky in this period of his soul's endangerment often suffers from both vertigo and sensory overload. On the vertiginous bridge, a sublimely terrifying view begins to open up around and below. He feels like he is flying, which for him is not as pleasant as it might seem to us.

[There used to be a river in this canyon, supporting a brewery, a distillery, a barley mill, and workers' terraces. The buildings and their occupants were destroyed, but the river is still there, although you cannot see it or reach it.]

Descending now, Zhigulevsky feels like he is falling, out of control on his skateboard and gathering speed towards the West End streets.


Sawyer is waiting on the sidewalk, smiling. Further along the street the flag of the Russian Federation reveals the location of the consulate.

"Looks like you had a rough ride."

"It is nothing. This is the address?"
  
"Down the alley there, through the tunnel to the courtyard, and through the passage on the right to another courtyard. That's where the church is, I think, pretty much behind the consulate."

"I appreciate your help."
  
"I know that girl, by the way."
  
"Which girl?"
  
"The one in the shop who was staring at you."
  
"I did not see anyone."
  
"She was there all right. She gives me the creeps. Sounds weird but I think she's living across the road there, in the library."
  
"Well, I must visit the church now."
  
"Say hi to Jesus for me."
  
"Thank you again."
  
Sawyer mounts his board and continues West. Laughing, he shakes his head and shouts to the street, "Shred it bro!" 

Zhigulevsky enters the alley and makes for the tunnel. On the ground, in amongst the nettles and dandelions which have grown through gaps in the cobbles, is a broken box with small Orthodox icons spilling out of it. One of them catches his eye, a reproduction of Our Lady of Kazan, depicting the Mother of God with Christ as a tiny man standing to her left. He bends down to pick it up.

"Don't touch that, it's dirty."

A voice from the street behind him. It is the woman who was hiding in the shop. He stands up and looks at her. She is strange [...]

"Please come back to the street," she says.
  
"Why? I do not know you."
  
"I saw you in the shop and have something to say to you. There is nothing there. You can have no business there."
  
"But I have an appointment here."
  
"There is nothing there. Come out of the alley and back to the street."
  
"I am sorry, but I cannot."

"Then just come here and let me talk to you for a minute. Please."

"All right, if it will make you happy."

As he returns to the street, she stands there biting her fingernails, her eyes unwaveringly fixed on him. 

§ § §

_THEOPHANES: It's her._

_MAKARIOS: Are you sure?_

_THEOPHANES: Almost._

_MAKARIOS: She does look weird, I have to admit. Well, since Father Georgy hasn't turned up, couldn't we get a message to the priest at the church?_

_THEOPHANES: Father Alexei is not an Intercessor, Brother. You know the rules. Anyway, he's busy tending his flock, small though it be. There's still time for Father Georgy to appear, and we must be careful not to interfere with his plan, whatever it is._

_MAKARIOS: We don't even know if he has one. Can't you request a direct interevention?_

_THEOPHANES: Your naiveté is almost endearing. These days, we and the Intercessors are the standard manifestation of angelic intervention. Only once in a hundred years do they take things into their own hands._

§ § §

"Your knee is bleeding," says the woman.
  
"Oh, yes. I fell from the skateboard."
  
"You should get it cleaned. Come over to the library with me and I'll get it fixed up."
  
"I am not certain that is a good idea."
  
"Come. It won't take long."
  
She takes hold of his arm, leads him across the road and then around the base of the steps that flow down from a colonnaded stone portico stained by soot and black algae. Still clutching his arm, she scurries down a flight of smaller, meaner steps descending to basement level and then along a mossy sunken passage to the corner of the edifice. Around this corner the foliage of a blackthorn tree hides a neglected door, where she releases him and rummages for the key in the roomy pocket of her ridiculous overcoat.

Inside, it is as cold as a cave. He follows her along an unhealthy corridor and into a small room. Light from a frosted window in the adjoining toilet room dimly illuminates a camp bed in one corner, an electric heater in another, and books piled up on the floor all over.

"Why do you live here?"

"Other parts of the library have cameras now, and nobody comes down here."

"No, I beg your pardon, I mean why do you live in the library?"

"Why not? Sit down there and I'll get some stuff for your knee."

She nods in the direction of an orange plastic stackable chair, and Zhigulevsky does as he is told.

As she heads for the door, Zhigulevsky says, "You sound Russian. _Vy russkiy? Ukrainets?_"

She turns and stares at him. Her bone-white face, with crimson lips and bloodshot eyes, seems to float in the air, disembodied and unnaturally bright in the murk.

"Just wait there."

She goes out and closes the door behind her. Now that Zhigulevsky is left alone with his thoughts, it is a good time to take a peek into his soul. We have not forgotten about it. That is what this is all about, after all.

He looks down at his bare arm, where she held him. He does not know if he can really still feel the physical traces --- a burning cold and a persistent deformation of the flesh --- or if the mental impression left by her touch is so strong that he merely imagines he can, or if there is any difference. He thinks about the last time he felt a woman's hand on his body. He was back home, lying on a beach on the Samara Bend after a swim, when Katya came up behind him, touched his wet shoulder, and handed him a massive slice of watermelon.

And the sand between his toes. And in the evening, Katya's  expression of concentration as she painstakingly balmed his sunburnt ears with beeswax.

[She returns, fixes his knee? and somehow eventually gets him to go down to the sub-basement, and then reveals her true form and begins to attack]

§ § §

_MAKARIOS: I can't see anything._

_THEOPHANES: On this occasion, it's not just you. She has performed an enchantment on the library to hide it from the eyes of God, which in this case means us._

_MAKARIOS: Magic spells? That stuff is real?_

_THEOPHANES: Of course. Any tradition surviving for millennia contains some genuine wisdom._

_MAKARIOS: Then I fear we have lost him. Lord grant rest to his soul._  

_THEOPHANES: Again, you are too quick. We can't see anything, so we do not know. And if he has indeed been taken, you know very well that his soul will be getting no rest._  

_MAKARIOS: He is in the lair of the Upyr. It's hopeless._  

_THEOPHANES: I also fear the worst, Brother, but still, I'd like to see with my own eyes, wouldn't you?_  

_MAKARIOS: See what, his body? Don't they eat it?_  

_THEOPHANES: Usually just the blood, and sometimes the heart if they're hungry. But no, I mean we need confirmation from his absence where we'd expect his presence were he alive._

_MAKARIOS: What?_

_THEOPHANES: If he fails to reappear outside the building in the next few hours, we can conclude with some justification that he is lost. But let us pray for him, Brother._  

_MAKARIOS: Pray for what, though? You already said direct intervention is out. Father, I don't like it. What is our role here? Weren't we supposed to guard his soul?_  

_THEOPHANES: To a degree, of course, but please remember your title. We are the Observers. We observed, and we sent our updates. It's up to the Intercessors now. It is a division of labour ordained by the Lord._

_MAKARIOS: Right now, I find I am questioning whether we have correctly interpreted His plan._

_THEOPHANES: Right now, I find I am needing a drink. There's nothing to see at the moment. Care for one?_  

_MAKARIOS: Go on then, you've twisted my arm._  

§ § §

Zhigulevsky hears her approaching. The door opens a fraction, and for a moment there is a strained silence. She is watching him, holding her breath. It is a matter of mere seconds, but time has become distended, an abyssal dream of temporality. She enters.

But it is not her, not exactly. Where bloodshot eyes stared from the pallid face of a young woman, there are milky globes set in viscid mucus and surrounded by contused flesh. In place of the crimson mouth there is a gaping orifice, where a carcinomic tongue writhes in a sheath of slime behind pointed glassy teeth.

Her bitten-down nails have become bony hooks, jutting from thick knuckles. Raising them, she charges.

Zhigulevsky finds he has raised the skateboard as a shield against the claws. He deflects the first slashing strike, springs onto his feet stand and pushes her back. She falls to the floor and squirms to right herself. He swings the skateboard up and back, but before he can bring it down on her head she pounces with an unhinged swiftness. She is going for his exposed chest, fangs poised for the fatal violation.

[to violate and rip out his heart]

But her body jerks and falls back. Someone is beating her. Zhigulevsky thinks he might be doing it himself, adrenaline having taken over [...]

"Gimme some help! Use your skateboard!"

Zhigulevsky snaps out of it and sees who it is. Sawyer, smashing the creature with his skateboard. His strikes are wild and scattershot [...] 

Zhigulevsky joins in the frenzied act of killing.


"I think it is an Upyr," says Zhigulevsky.

"Oo-peer. What the hell is that?"

"Like a vampire. My grandmother taught me about them. We must cut off the head."

"Jesus," says Sawyer. "Seriously?"

"If we do not, the evil spirit can leave this body and enter another."

The body was transforming before their eyes, returning to the pathetic figure of a skinny naked girl, contracted like a fetus.

Sawyer opens his backpack and brings out the saw.

"Here, this should do it."



Later...

"I looked back and saw you with that library girl. Something didn't seem right. Came to see you were okay."




He mounts the skateboard and heads East. He is getting the hang of it now.

§ § §

_THEOPHANES: I had better get back to my Soulglass._

_MAKARIOS: Don't worry old man, there was no sign of him last time I looked. Have another drink._

_THEOPHANES: Brother, you forget yourself. You are drunk._

_MAKARIOS: No more than you are, Father. The whole thing's over anyway. The vampire bitch made a banquet of his body, gobbled down his heart and had his balls for dessert!_

_THEOPHANES: Enough! Zhigulevsky's passing is not an occasion for gleeful vulgarity. And keep your voice down. I'm the one who'll get in trouble with the Igumen. By the way, don't call it a vampire. An Upyr isn't quite the same thing._

_MAKARIOS: Oh here we go. Theophanopadopoulous the Sage, kindly regale us with your pagan lore! No wait, let me do it. Upyrs only drink Slavic blood, right?_

_THEOPHANES: Obviously. What else?_

_MAKARIOS: Sunlight? Yes, they don't mind a bit of sunbathing now and then, unlike those delicate Western ones._

_THEOPHANES: I don't know if Hungary and Romania count as Western, but yes, another point for Makarios. Resounding applause. What else? ... Brother?_

_MAKARIOS: I've forgotten. I don't feel well, Father. I think have to leave now. I shall go to my, uh, repose, with God's blessing._

_THEOPHANES: Well and good. The Lord has apparently interceded for your own benefit. Better late than never (forgive me Lord)._

_MAKARIOS: What?_

_THEOPHANES: Never mind. Oh and don't bother with Midnight Office tonight. I'll tell them you're ill. Go with God, Brother. But pass me that bottle first._

NOTE: Later that day we received an update from Father Theophanes affirming that Zhigulevsky had been killed. This was at best a suppositional assertion, made without observational confirmation. It hardly needs to be said that this, among other things, represents a serious dereliction of duty. Both Father Observer Theophanes and Brother Observer Makarios are undergoing re-training.

§ § §

Zhigulevsky has chosen a window seat on the right side of the plane so that he can see the Zhiguli mountains during the descent. But they are no more than hills to him now. Maybe Timur had been right. Timur used to annoy everyone in geography class, including the teacher, by insisting that they were not mountains at all, that if they wanted to see mountains they ought to go to the Altai and the Tien Shan. Timur had not been to those places but his father had. Zhigulevsky has now been to those places --- and to the Caucasus, the Alps, the Andes and the Rockies --- and sees that Timur had had a point.

At the airport he calls Katya to tell her he has landed and that he will see her in half an hour. He tells her to open a window and hang some garlic around the door. She laughs and tells him he is crazy, but he insists.

**CONCLUSION**

We give praise that Zhigulevsky's soul was safeguarded on this occasion. Whether or not he shall remain untouched by the agents of Satan is not for us to speculate. It is true that there are signs of a growth in demonic activity in Holy Rus, but we trust in the vitality of the faithful and the locally excellent track record of folkloric protection against unclean spirits (and critics say we are intolerant of paganism!). 

We shall not attempt here a divination, but all indications are that the couple will go on to be happy and fruitful in a log cabin in a forest of birch, pine, and oak, with a view over the river to the Zhiguli mountains, if they are indeed mountains.

We regret that we cannot end on that happy note. This is not a time for complacency. It is expected that new evidence will conclusively establish that the missing Russian nationals were victims of the Upyr, and strenuous efforts are being made to recover their remains and to dispose of them in the proper way. Though slim, the possibility that one or more of these victims have themselves become Upyrs cannot be ruled out. For this reason, a new team of Intercessors will be working on the clean-up operation, in accordance with the new edition of the Manuals of Ritual (See appendix A).

_NOTE: Father Georgy, who we later discovered was making an unauthorized pilgrimmage to Cyprus during the events discussed, is no longer working as a field operative._

Taking a wider view, it is clear that there is much work for us ahead. The end of the Soviet Union has been a mixed blessing. Foreign travel and migration from Russia has grown and will continue to do so, with the result that Russians will increasingly be exposed to those Slavic minions of the Devil who remain in exile, without the effective syncretic protections operative in their homeland. We must remain vigilant lest the children of Holy Rus go the way of the Western Europeans.

There are matters demanding more immediate action. Our organization has been cast in an unflattering light. The shocking series of failures and improprieties apparent in our earthly institutions must be addressed. We recommend a root cause analysis following discussion at the forthcoming Assembly.

By the grace of Heaven, may this report serve in the ongoing protection of the faithful, entrusted to Your vigilance.

In Service and Humility,  
Orphiel, Senior Overseer, Observation and Intervention (UK)

**APPENDIX A: Proper Destruction and Disposal of an Upyr**

Folklore being what it is, there are various myths surrounding this topic. We have established the correct procedure, and we include it here for convenience; it can also be found in the Manuals of Ritual.

Once the creature has been incapacitated by the ordinary methods, the following points must be observed:

Options for destruction:

1. Decapitation
2. Wooden stake through the heart. Contrary to the legends, the type of wood is unimportant: any sturdy pointed wooden shaft will do.
3. Drowning

Options for disposal (when the creature has not been drowned):

1. Bury the corpse securely nailed down in a coffin, then apply holy water. For instances of decapitation, first place the head between the legs, facing down.
2. Burn the corpse and bury the ashes in an unmarked pit.


**APPENDIX B: Intercepted Message from the Upyr**

We were surprised to intercept a message from the creature herself. It was this circumstance that made us realize that she had not been properly destroyed, even though Zhigulevsky had done more than could have been expected. We rectified this quickly and efficiently.

_I began to love you from the moment I saw you in the skateshop and the deep and complex scent of your blood reached me._

_How could I resist?_
