—Sokolov is wandering.

—Where?

—He wanders.

—Yes, but where?

—Here and there, as they say, I expect.  

—What I am wanting is a straight answer.  

—You are wanting.  

—I am.  

—You want.  

—I do.  

—You _always_ want.
 
**~**

Sokolov is wandering in quiet business district streets. It is getting close to the close of the twentieth century. It is mostly empty buildings and empty corner cafés, all closed, because it is Sunday in the business district. It has been hot and dry like this for many days, and the as-yet unswept and unhosed working week's dust rises and falls with the tabloid pages and bus tickets in the warm street-channelled breezes, golden where caught in chinks of afternoon sunlight admitted by gaps up high.

But look: here is an anomalous shop, anomalously open, its door wide open. It is for skateboarding things. Boards, parts, and accessories --- a natural commercial configuration, not imposed but flowing organically from a technological Eros. A shop, then, which is anomalous yet in itself coherent. Generally there is sense to be made at some level, if you look closely enough.

And listen: they are playing fast aggressive rock music, which echoes off the street's high walls of sandstone and concrete and glass. There is more glass here than in other districts and the music's acoustic trajectories are unscattered by hard traffic and undampened by soft pedestrians, so the echoes are unusually loud. Sokolov, buffeted by them, his memory in turn nudged awake by this buffeting, now remembers the scrap of paper in his shorts pocket, and is no longer wandering. With singular purpose, he enters.

Within, a young man on the customer side of the counter is sawing to the rhythm through a short thick plank of timber, which is clamped to the counter. A somewhat older man on the staff side, the manager, who has been grinning and watching the young man, watches the young man again and grins again after having glanced at the entering stranger ungrinningly.

An off-duty trainee librarian, her browsing interrupted by Sokolov's appearance, rushes past him and out to the street, moving like a weasel and resembling, with her unseasonal coat flapping around her, like a pipistrelle. The music stops. The young man stops sawing, pants, and stares at Sokolov. The manager speaks.

—What do you want? You're not a skateboarder.  

—How can you know this?  

—I'm a skateboarder.  

—But I am a skateboarder too.  

—No way you're a skateboarder my foreign friend.  

—You are correct, and I apologize for the deception. In fact, I only want to know where is this address. It does not seem to be on a map.  

He shows the scrap of paper to the manager, who reads and frowns, reads and frowns, shakes his head and shakes his head and passes the scrap of paper to the other man, who reads, stops panting, and nods.

—Why are you going to this address?

—It is a private matter.  

—It's hard to get to.  

—Perhaps you can write down the directions.  

—Perhaps you can get a taxi.  

—There are no taxis in this district.  

—I'm going that way, so I can take you.   

—Please, is it possible for you to write down the directions?  

—No.  

—In that case I will come with you.  

—I'll be on my board, so you'll need a board too, to keep up.  

—I could run.

—No.  

—I do not want to buy a skateboard.

The manager says hold on, goes to another room, and returns with an old skateboard.

—You can borrow this. It's seen better days, but it's solid.  

—You are very kind, but only if you are certain.  

—It's got low trucks so it's nice and stable.  

—That is ideal, since I am a novice.  

—Do you want a helmet? Pads?  

—No, I will take the risks.  

—Have it back by five. Shred it bro.

The manager laughs, and the younger man laughs too while he gathers up the plank of wood, the saw, and the clamp, puts them in a backpack, and grabs his board.

Out on the street, they mount the boards and head West. The surface is smooth, but Sokolov has never been on a skateboard and struggles to keep up and stay on. Soon they are on a footpath bridging [...] Eventually the streets open out to the highway, and they span the junction on the overpass [...]

—Sokolov is no longer wandering.  

—I noticed.  

—You finally getting the hang of it, eh?  

—No thanks to you. Anyway look.  

—Yes, this is a development.  

—He is heading West.  

—I hope _not_ towards a bright future.  

—Towards the point of convergence, is what we can say right now. We shall see.  

—Yes, this could be a good development.  

—Or it could be the worst development imaginable.

The man is waiting for Sokolov on the sidewalk.

—This is the address?  

—It is the metal door in that alley. Can you see it?  

—It was not difficult to find. You could have given me the directions.  

—You would not have found it.  

—I appreciate your help.  

—I know that girl.  

—Which girl?  

—The one who left.  

—Oh.  

—She lives across the road there, in the Central Library, but do not tell anyone.  

—My mouth is closed.  

—She will be going there now.  

—I did not see her.  

—She goes by other ways.  

—I must visit this address now.  

—Good luck.

—Thank you.

The young man mounts his board and continues West. Sokolov approaches the door, stepping over broken pallets and broken panes of glass.

—Where are you going?

A voice from behind. It is the trainee librarian, who has seen him on her way to the library.

—I need to visit this address.  

—There is nothing there. Please come back to the street.  

—Why?  

—Please. There is nothing there. You can have no business there.  

—You live in the Central Library.  

—I told him not to tell anyone.  

—Please do not worry. My mouth is closed.  

—There is nothing there. Come out of the alley and back to the street.  

—I will because it will make you happy.  

—Your knee is bleeding.  

—Oh.  

—Is it from the glass?  

—No, it must have been my fall from the skateboard.  

—You are inexperienced in skateboarding.  

—That is correct.  

—You should get it cleaned. Come over to the library with me.  

—You do not know me.

—Come.

She takes hold of his arm and leads him across the road and then around the base of the steps that flow generously down from the library's colonnaded portico of sandstone stained by soot and black algae to an abutting flight of smaller, meaner steps that descend to basement level, and then, still towing him by the arm, darts down these steps and turns into a mossy sunken passage and proceeds along it to the corner of the main edifice, over which is a crab apple tree growing over the passage and hiding a neglected door, where she releases him and rummages for the key in the capacious pocket of her ridiculous overcoat.

Inside, he follows her along a mouldering corridor and into a small room.

—Why do you live here?

—Other parts of the library have cameras now, and nobody comes down here.

—No, sorry, I mean why do you live in the library?

—Why not? Sit down there and I'll fix your knee.

She nods in the direction of an orange plastic stackable chair, and Sokolov does as he is told.

When she leaves the room he looks down at his forearm, where she held him. He does not know if he can really still feel the physical traces, a warmth and a persistent deformation of the flesh, or if the mental impression left by her touch is so strong that he merely imagines he can --- or if there is a difference. He thinks about the last time he felt a woman's hand on him. He was back home, lying on a beach on the Samara Bend at the tail-end of summer, when she came up behind him, touched his wet shoulder, and handed him a massive slice of watermelon.



[...]

[Mouldering (the corner of the library she lives in)]

[Inside the library, she tells him there is an underground passage leading to the address across the road, but it's a trap]

**~**

—Sokolov is dead.

—Indeed, well done. Are you crying?

—Of course not. I'm happy. It's a job well done.

—Yes, it's a day to celebrate.

—Discreetly.

—A discreet celebration is close to oxymoronic.

—Not really. I wasn't thinking of having the others join us. I'm having a drink right here. Care for one?

—Go on then, you've twisted my arm.

[Librarian addressing ... who? The sawing man, maybe.]
I loved you from the moment you stepped out of the shadows to kill Sokolov. It was your way of moving, like megaliths reconfiguring. Your movements had a steady grace that belied their speed and power. And when you carefully pressed the blade through his eye and into his brain it was as if you were correcting a cosmic injustice. Because you, alone among men, possessed the knowledge to judge. It was as if the world, stately and in its own time, was redressing the wrong that had been done to it.

How could I resist?
