—Sokolov is wandering.

—Where?

—He wanders.

—Yes, but where?

—Here and there, as they say, I expect.  

—What I am wanting is a straight answer.  

—You are wanting.  

—I am.  

—You want.  

—I do.  

—You _always_ want.
 
**~**

Sokolov is wandering in quiet business district streets. It is getting close to the close of the twentieth century. It is mostly empty buildings and empty corner cafés, all closed, because it is Sunday in the business district. It has been hot and dry like this for many days, and the as-yet unswept and unhosed working week's dust rises and falls with the tabloid pages and bus tickets in the warm street-funneled breezes, golden where caught in chinks of sunlight admitted by gaps up high.

But look: here is an anomalous shop, anomalously open, its door wide open. It is for skateboarding things. Boards, parts, and accessories --- a natural commercial configuration, not imposed but flowing organically from a technological Eros. A shop, then, which is anomalous but in itself coherent.

And listen: they are playing fast aggressive rock music, which echoes loud off the street's high walls of sandstone, concrete and glass, the sound's waves uninterrupted by hard traffic and undamped by soft pedestrians. Sokolov, buffeted by them, his memory in turn nudged awake by this buffeting, now remembers the scrap of paper in his shorts pocket, and is no longer wandering. With a singular purpose, he enters.

Within, there are two men, Manager and Woodsawyer. Woodsawyer, a young man on the customer side of the counter, is sawing to the rhythm of the music through a short thick plank of timber, which is clamped to the counter. Manager, on the staff side of the counter, who has been grinning and watching Woodsawyer, watches Woodsawyer again and grins again after having glanced at Sokolov the entering stranger ungrinningly.

Unbeknownst to Sokolov, there is also a woman, Trainee Librarian. Her browsing interrupted by Sokolov's appearance, Trainee Librarian now rushes past him and out to the street, moving like a weasel, but, with her unseasonal coat flapping around her, also resembling a pipistrelle. The music stops. Woodsawyer stops sawing, pants, and stares at Sokolov. Manager speaks.

—What do you want, mister? You're no skateboarder.  

—Good day, and how can you know this?  

—I'm a skateboarder.  

—But I am a skateboarder too.  

—No way you're a skateboarder my foreign friend.  

—You are correct, and I apologize for the attempted deception. In fact, I only want to know where is this address. It does not seem to be on a map.  

He shows the scrap of paper to Manager, who reads and frowns, reads and frowns, shakes his head and shakes his head and passes the scrap of paper to Woodsawyer, who reads, stops panting, and nods.

—Why are you going to this address?

—It is a private matter.  

—It's hard to get to.  

—Perhaps you can write down the directions.  

—Perhaps you can get a taxi.  

—There are no taxis in this district.  

—Well, it just so happens I'm going that way, so I can take you.   

—Please, is it possible for you to write down the directions?  

—No.  

—In that case I will come with you.  

—I'll be on my board, so you'll need a board too, to keep up.  

—I could run.

—No.  

—I do not want to buy a skateboard.

The manager says hold on, goes to another room, and returns with an old skateboard.

—You can borrow this. It's seen better days, but it's solid.  

—You are very kind, but only if you are certain.  

—It's got low trucks so it's nice and stable.  

—That is ideal, as I am a novice.  

—You want a helmet? Pads?  

—No, I will take the risks.  

—Have it back by five. Shred it bro.

Manager laughs, and Woodsawyer laughs too while he gathers up the plank of wood, the saw, and the clamp, puts them in a backpack, and grabs his board.

Out on the street, they mount the boards and head West. The surface is smooth, but Sokolov has never been on a skateboard and struggles to keep up and stay on. Soon they leave behind the buildings and climb a ramped footpath leading to a concrete footbridge that soars over a canyon occupied by a sprawling highway interchange where there used to be a river, a brewery, a distillery, and a barley mill. The river is still there, but you cannot see it or reach it.

Sokolov is a long way behind when Woodsawyer reaches the crest of the bridge and disappears over it. When Sokolov reaches the crest himself, he stops out of fear and awe. 

... vertiginous ... feels like he is flying 

**~**

—Sokolov is no longer wandering.  

—I noticed.  

—You finally getting the hang of it, eh?  

—No thanks to you. Anyway look.  

—Yes, this is a development.  

—He is heading West.  

—I hope _not_ towards a bright future.  

—Towards the point of convergence, is what we can say right now. We shall see.  

—Yes, this could be a good development.  

—Or it could be the worst development imaginable.  

**~**

Woodsawyer is waiting for Sokolov on the sidewalk.

—This is the address?  

—See the metal door in that alley? That's it.

—It was not difficult to find. You could have given me the directions.  

—You wouldn't have found it.  

—I appreciate your help.  

—I know that girl.  

—Which girl?  

—The one who left.  

—Oh.  

—She lives across the road there, in the Central Library, but don't tell anyone.  

—My mouth is closed.  

—She'll likely be going there now.  

—I did not see her.  

—She goes by other ways.  

—I must visit this address now.  

—Good luck.

—Thank you.

Woodsawyer mounts his board and continues West.

Sokolov enters the alley and makes for the door, but the way is blocked by a jumble of wreckage: wooden pallets in various stages of disintegration, shattered panes and scattered splinters of glass, tabloid pages and bus tickets, a sack of cement, nettles and dandelions, a dead pigeon on an upside-down plastic bread tray, its wings spread out. Something scuttles to a nook as Sokolov begins to clamber and scramble towards the metal door.

—Where are you going?

A voice from the street behind him. It is Trainee Librarian, who has seen him on her way to the library.

—I need to visit this address.  

—There is nothing there. Please come back to the street.  

—Why?  

—Please. There is nothing there. You can have no business there.  

—You live in the Central Library.  

—Jesus Christ, I told him not to tell anyone.  

—Please do not worry. My mouth is closed.  

—There is nothing there. Come out of the alley and back to the street.  

—If it will make you happy, then I will.  

—Your knee is bleeding.  

—Oh.  

—Is it from the glass?  

—No, it must have been my fall from the skateboard.  

—You're not much of a skateboarder, I suppose.  

—That is correct.  

—You should get it cleaned. Come over to the library with me.  

—You do not know me.

—Come.

She takes hold of his arm and leads him across the road and then around the base of the steps that flow generously down from the library's colonnaded portico of sandstone stained by soot and black algae to an abutting flight of smaller, meaner steps that descend to basement level, and, still towing him by the arm, scurries down them and along a mossy sunken passage to the corner of the edifice, around which the foliage of a crab apple tree hides a neglected door, where she releases him and rummages for the key in the capacious pocket of her ridiculous overcoat.

Inside, he follows her along a mouldering corridor and into a small room. Light from a frosted window in the adjoining toilet room dimly illuminates a camp bed in one corner, an electric heater in another, and books piled up on the floor all over. She turns on the bedside lamp.

—Why do you live here?

—Other parts of the library have cameras now, and nobody comes down here.

—No, I beg your pardon, I mean why do you live in the library?

—Why not? Sit down there and I'll get some stuff for your knee.

She nods in the direction of an orange plastic stackable chair, and Sokolov does as he is told.

When Trainee Librarian leaves the room he looks down at his forearm, where she held him. He does not know if he can really still feel the physical traces, a warmth and a persistent deformation of the flesh, or if the mental impression left by her touch is so strong that he merely imagines he can --- or if there is any difference. He thinks about the last time he felt a woman's hand on him. He was back home, lying on a beach on the Samara Bend after a swim, when Katya came up behind him, touched his wet shoulder, and handed him a massive slice of watermelon. And the sand between his toes.

—You should moisturize your ears.

—I do not think it is necessary.

—You must know that your ears are dry and crusty?

—Now that you have brought it to my attention, I see that you are right.

—Good. Now ...

[...]

[Inside the library, she tells him there is an underground passage leading to the address across the road, but it's a trap]

—Leave the skateboard.

—No, I must return it today.

—Leave it with me. I can take it back.

She grabs it, but Sokolov holds on to it.

—I am a man of my word. It is my responsibility to return it. I will go to the address now, and later I will go to the shop.

**~**

—Sokolov is dead.

—Indeed, well done. Don't cry.

—Haha. I'm happy. It's a job well done.

—Yes, it's a day to celebrate.

—Discreetly.

—That is somewhat contradictory, isn't it?

—Not really. I wasn't thinking of having the others join us. I'm having a drink right here. Care for one?

—Go on then, you've twisted my arm.

**~**

I began to love you from the moment you stepped out of the shadows to kill Sokolov. It was your way of moving, like a reconfiguration of ancient megaliths. Your movements had a steady grace, and when you carefully pressed the blade through his eye and into his brain it was as if you were correcting a cosmic injustice. Because you, alone among men, possessed the knowledge to judge. It was as if the world, stately and in its own time, were redressing the wrong that had been done to it.

How could I resist?

**~**

Patient reader, do not pay attention to them. Sokolov did not in fact die in that alleged tunnel, which was in fact a tunnel. The Observers and Trainee Librarian and everyone else involved were utterly fooled, somehow. I was as surprised as anyone. I do not know how he managed it. I was not there, and Sokolov has never revealed it as far as I know. (There is no longer anyone around to care if he did, but that is another story).

[...]  

What I can say is that Sokolov smashes his attacker over the head with his skateboard and runs along the tunnel into complete darkness. His instinct for self-preservation overcomes the vertigo of running without vision, but he takes the precaution of reaching out in front, and soon enough his fingertips crash painfully into stone. He feels around and finds steps going up.

He mounts the skateboard 


He has chosen a seat on the the right side of the plane so he can see the Zhiguli mountains in the final descent. They look no more than hills to him now. Maybe Timur was right. Timur used to annoy everyone in geography class, including the teacher, by insisting that they were not mountains at all, that if they wanted to see mountains they ought to go to the Altai and the Tien Shan. Timur had not been to those places but his father had.
