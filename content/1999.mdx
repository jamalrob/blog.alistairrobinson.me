—Sokolov is wandering.

—Where?

—He wanders.

—Yes, but where?

—Here and there, as they say, I expect.  

—What I am wanting is a straight answer.  

—You are wanting.  

—I am.  

—You want.  

—I do.  

—You _always_ want.

Sokolov is wandering in quiet business district streets. It is getting close to the close of the twentieth century. It is mostly empty buildings and empty corner cafés, all closed, because it is Sunday in the business district. But look: here is an anomalous shop, anomalously open, its door wide open. It is for skateboarding things. Boards, parts, and accessories --- a natural commercial configuration. And listen: they are playing fast aggressive rock music, which echoes off the street's high unbroken walls. Sokolov remembers the scrap of paper in his pocket and is no longer wandering. With singular purpose, he enters.

Within, a young man on the customer side of the counter is sawing to the rhythm through a short thick plank of timber, which is clamped to the counter. A somewhat older man on the staff side, the manager, who has been grinning and watching the young man, watches the young man again and grins again, after having glanced for a moment at the entering stranger ungrinningly.

An off-duty trainee librarian, her browsing interrupted by Sokolov's appearance, rushes past him like a weasel and out to the street. The music stops. The young man stops sawing, pants, and stares at Sokolov. The manager speaks.

—What do you want? You are not a skateboarder.  

—How can you know this?  

—I am a skateboarder.  

—But I am a skateboarder too.  

—You are lying.  

—It is fair, you are correct. In fact, I only want to know where is this address. It does not seem to be on a map.  

He shows the scrap of paper to the manager, who reads and frowns, reads and frowns, shakes his head and shakes his head and passes the scrap of paper to the other man, who reads, stops panting, and nods.

—Why are you going to this address?

—It is a private matter.  

—It is hard to get to.  

—Perhaps you can write down the directions.  

—Perhaps you can get a taxi.  

—There are no taxis in this district.  

—I am going that way, so I can take you.   

—Please, is it possible for you to write down the directions?  

—No.  

—In that case I will follow you.  

—I will be on my board, so you will need a board too if you want to keep up with me.  

—I could run.

—No.  

—I do not want to buy a skateboard.

The manager says hold on, goes to another room, and returns with an old skateboard.

—You can borrow this. It has seen better days, but it is good.  

—You are very kind, but only if you are certain.  

—It has low trucks, so it is very stable.  

—That is ideal, since I am a novice.  

—Do you want a helmet? Pads?  

—No, I will take the risks.  

—Have it back by five. Shred it.

The manager laughs, and the younger man laughs too, while he gathers up the plank of wood, the saw, and the clamp, puts them in a backpack, and grabs his board.

Out on the street, they mount the boards and head West. The surface is smooth, but Sokolov has never been on a skateboard and struggles to keep up and stay on. Soon they are on a footpath bridging [...] Eventually the streets open out to the highway, and they span the junction on the overpass [...]

—Sokolov is no longer wandering.  

—I noticed.  

—You finally getting the hang of it, eh?  

—No thanks to you. Anyway look.  

—Yes, this is a development.  

—He is heading West.  

—I hope _not_ towards a bright future.  

—Towards the library, is what we can say right now. We shall see.

The man is waiting for Sokolov on the sidewalk.

—This is the address?  

—It is the metal door in that alley. Can you see it?  

—It was not difficult to find. You could have given me the directions.  

—You would not have found it.  

—I appreciate your help.  

—I know that girl.  

—Which girl?  

—The one who left.  

—Oh.  

—She lives across the road there, in the library, but do not tell anyone.  

—My mouth is closed.  

—She will be going there now.  

—I did not see her.  

—She goes by other ways.  

—I must visit this address now.  

—Good luck.

—Goodbye, and thank you again.

The young man mounts his board and continues West. Sokolov approaches the door, stepping over broken pallets and broken panes of glass.

—Where are you going?

A voice from behind. It is the librarian, who has seen him on her way to the library.

—I need to visit this address.  

—There is nothing there. Please come back to the street.  

—Why?  

—Please. There is nothing there. You can have no business there.  

—You live in the library.  

—I told him not to tell anyone.  

—Please do not worry. I will not tell anyone.  

—There is nothing there. Come out of the alley and back to the street.  

—I will because it will make you happy.  

—Your knee is bleeding.  

—Oh.  

—Is it from the glass?  

—No, it must have been my fall from the skateboard.  

—You are inexperienced in skateboarding.  

—That is correct.  

—You should get it cleaned. Come over to the library with me.  

—You do not know me.

I loved you from the moment you stepped out of the shadows to confront Sokolov. It was your way of moving, like megaliths reconfiguring. Even when you deflected his first strike your movements had a steady grace that belied their speed and power. And when you carefully pressed the blade through his eye and into his brain it was as if you were correcting a cosmic injustice. Because you, alone among men, possessed the knowledge to judge. It was as if the world, stately and in its own time, was redressing the wrong that had been done to it.

How could I resist?
