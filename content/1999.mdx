Further to our formal reports concerning the disappearance of Russian nationals in the vicinity of the Consulate of the Russian Federation, we here present a supporting narrative distillation based upon our own supervisory oversight, specifically regarding the case of the otherwise unremarkable Lapushkin. Readers will, I trust, forgive the flagrant exercise of our poetic licence.

For context we shall interpolate excerpts of the recorded conversations of our two Observers, which might additionally shed some light on a certain privation of monastic decorum in the expatriate divisions of the Order.

_FATHER OBSERVER THEOPHANES: Lapushkin is wandering._  

_BROTHER OBSERVER MAKARIOS: Where?_  

_THEOPHANES: He wanders._  

_MAKARIOS: Yes, but where?_  

_THEOPHANES: Here and there, as they say, I expect._  

_MAKARIOS: Respectfully Father, what I am wanting is a straight answer._  

_THEOPHANES: Oh, you are wanting all right. Wanting in patience, for one thing._  

_MAKARIOS: That being the case, I would be happy, blissfully so in fact, to ask for reassignment. I do very much want to get on with the job._  

_THEOPHANES: Again, you want. Want want want want want._  

_MAKARIOS: Respectfully Father, might I ask if you are quite secure in your understanding of the concept of mentorship? From whom can I learn but you?_  

_THEOPHANES: Very well, permit me to suggest a mutually beneficial agreement. I shall impart to you with good grace the secrets of the Order, and you shall, one: endeavour to conceal your talent for irksomeness; and two: adorn your endless Respectfully Fathers with some genuine respect._  

_MAKARIOS: Deal._

And here he is: Lapushkin, wandering in quiet business district streets. It is getting close to the close of the twentieth century. It is mostly empty buildings and empty corner cafés, all closed, because it is Sunday in the business district. It has been hot and dry like this for many days, and the as-yet unswept and unhosed working week's dust rises and falls with the tabloid pages and bus tickets in the street-funneled breezes, golden where caught in chinks of sunlight admitted by gaps up high.

But look: here is an anomalous shop, anomalously open, its door wide open. It is for skateboarding things. Boards, parts, and accessories --- a natural configuration. A shop, then, which is anomalous in context but is in itself coherent, and thus rests within the order appointed by Christ Himself.

And listen: they are playing fast aggressive rock music, which echoes loud off the street's high walls of polished stone cladding and glass, the sound's waves unscattered by traffic and undamped by pedestrians. Lapushkin, buffeted by them, his memory in turn nudged awake by this buffeting, now remembers the scrap of paper in his shorts pocket, and is no longer wandering. With a singular purpose, he enters.

Meet the two men within: Skateshop Manager and Sawyer. Sawyer, a young man on the customer side of the counter, is sawing to the rhythm of the music through a short thick plank of timber, which is clamped to the counter. Skateshop Manager, a moderately older man on the staff side of the counter who has been grinning and watching Sawyer, watches Sawyer again and grins again after having glanced at Lapushkin ungrinningly.

Lapushkin will find out in a moment that there is also a woman: Trainee Librarian. There she is, examining wheels (which might raise suspicions, since she is no more a skater than is Lapushkin). Her browsing has now been interrupted by Lapushkin's appearance, and she rushes past him and out to the street, moving like a weasel, and, with her unseasonal coat flapping around her, also resembling a pipistrelle in flight. The music stops. Sawyer stops sawing and stares at Lapushkin. Skateshop Manager speaks.

"What do you want, mister? You're no skater."  

"Good day. But how can you know this?"  

"I'm a skater."  

"Perhaps I am a skater too."  

"No way you're a skater my foreign friend."  

"Yes, okay, you are right. In fact, I only want to know where is this address. I know it is near the Russian Consulate, but I do not know where that is."  

He shows the scrap of paper to Skateshop Manager, who reads and frowns, reads and frowns, shakes his head and shakes his head and passes it to Sawyer, who reads it and nods.

"It's hard to get to."  

"Perhaps you can write down the directions."  

"Perhaps you can get a taxi."  

"There are no taxis in this district."  

"Well, it just so happens I'm going that way, so I can take you."  

"Please, is it possible for you tell me how to get there myself?"  

"No, you wouldn't find it."  

"In that case I will come with you."  

"I'll be on my board, so you'll need a board too, to keep up."  

"I could run."  

"No."  

"I do not want to buy a skateboard."  

Skateshop Manager says hold on, goes to another room, and returns with an old skateboard.

"You can borrow this. The deck's seen better days, but the rest is solid."  
  
"You are very kind, but only if you are certain."  
  
"It's got low trucks so it's nice and stable."  
  
"That sounds ideal, as I am a novice."  
  
"You want a helmet? Pads?"  
  
"No, I will take the risks."  
  
"Have it back by five thirty. Shred it bro."  

Skateshop Manager laughs, and Sawyer laughs too while he gathers up the plank of wood, the saw, and the clamp, puts them in a backpack, and grabs his board.

Out on the street, they mount the boards and head West. The surface is smooth, but Lapushkin has never been on a skateboard and struggles to keep up and stay on. He is going as fast as he can, but Sawyer continues to recede into the distance ahead.

Lapushkin passes the end of the business district at the Eastern edge of an urbanized ravine --- and keeps on going. Although the buildings have come to an end, and the road curves down into the sprawling highway interchange that occupies the depths below, Lapushkin heads for Heaven. For Sawyer has just crested a shallowly parabolic reinforced concrete footbridge, which elegantly traverses the great gap with the help of only two slender piers.

As the reader may already know from previous dispatches and epistolary reports, Lapushkin in this period of his soul's endangerment often suffers from both vertigo and sensory overload. On the vertiginous bridge, a sublimely terrifying view begins to open up around and below. He feels like he is flying, which for him is not as pleasant as it might seem to us.

There used to be a river in this canyon, supporting a brewery, a distillery, a barley mill, and workers' terraces. The buildings and their occupants were destroyed, but the river is still there, although you cannot see it or reach it.

Descending now, Lapushkin feels like he is falling, out of control on his skateboard and gathering speed towards the West End streets.

_THEOPHANES: Lapushkin is no longer wandering._  

_MAKARIOS: I noticed._  

_THEOPHANES: Oh, so you're getting the hang of it now, are you? Such precocity!_  

_MAKARIOS: Entirely owing to your solicitous guidance, Father. Anyway look, he is heading West._  

_THEOPHANES: Into a bright future, or ---_  

_MAKARIOS: Into the darkest danger._  

_THEOPHANES: And possible salvation. Let us pray for him Brother._

Sawyer is waiting on the sidewalk, smiling.

"Looks like you had a rough ride."

"It is nothing. This is the address?"
  
"See the metal door in that alley? That's it."
  
"It was not difficult to find. You could have told me how to reach it."
  
"You wouldn't have found it."
  
"I appreciate your help."
  
"I know that girl."
  
"Which girl?"
  
"The one who left in a hurry."
  
"Oh."
  
"Sounds weird but I think she's living across the road there, in the library. She gives me the creeps."
  
"Well, thank you for your help."
  
"She'll likely be going there now."
  
"I did not see her on the route."
  
"She goes by other ways."
  
"Well, I must visit this address now."
  
"Good luck."
  
"Thank you."
  
Sawyer mounts his board and continues West. Laughing, he shakes his head and shouts to the street, "Shred it bro!" 

Lapushkin enters the alley and makes for the door. There are wooden pallets in various stages of disintegration, shattered panes and scattered splinters of glass, tabloid pages and bus tickets, a sack of cement, nettles and dandelions, a dead pigeon on an upside-down plastic bakery tray, its wings spread out. Something scuttles to a nook as Lapushkin begins to clamber and scramble towards the metal door, using the skateboard to clear the way.

"Where are you going?"

A voice from the street behind him. It is Trainee Librarian, who has seen him on her way to the library.

"I need to visit this address."
  
"There is nothing there. Please come back to the street."
  
"Why?"
  
"Please. There is nothing there. You can have no business there."
  
"I have an appointment here."
  
"There is nothing there. Come out of the alley and back to the street."
  
"If it will make you happy, then I will."
  
"Your knee is bleeding."
  
"Oh, yes."
  
"Is it from the glass?"
  
"No, I fell from the skateboard."
  
"You should get it cleaned. Come over to the library with me and I'll get it fixed up."
  
"But you do not know me."
  
"Come."
  
She takes hold of his arm and leads him across the road and then around the base of the steps that flow generously down from the library's colonnaded stone portico stained by soot and black algae to an abutting flight of smaller, meaner steps descending to basement level, and, still towing him by the arm, scurries down them and along a mossy sunken passage to the corner of the edifice, around which the loaded foliage of a crab apple tree hides a neglected door, where she releases him and rummages for the key in the roomy pocket of her ridiculous overcoat.

Inside, it is cold as a cave. He follows her along an unhealthy corridor and into a small room. Light from a frosted window in the adjoining toilet room dimly illuminates a camp bed in one corner, an electric heater in another, and books piled up on the floor all over. She turns on the bedside lamp.

"Why do you live here?"

"Other parts of the library have cameras now, and nobody comes down here."

"No, I beg your pardon, I mean why do you live in the library?"

"Why not? Sit down there and I'll get some stuff for your knee."

She nods in the direction of an orange plastic stackable chair, and Lapushkin does as he is told.

Trainee Librarian leaves the room. Now that Lapushkin is just sitting there doing nothing, it is probably a good time to take a peek into his soul (or psyche, if you prefer). Did you think he did not have one? Did you think we did not know what was in it? No, we can read souls just fine. We can even read yours.

He looks down at his bare arm, where she held him. He does not know if he can really still feel the physical traces --- a warmth and a persistent deformation of the flesh --- or if the mental impression left by her touch is so strong that he merely imagines he can, or if there is any difference. He thinks about the last time he felt a woman's hand on him. He was back home, lying on a beach on the Samara Bend after a swim, when Katya came up behind him, touched his wet shoulder, and handed him a massive slice of watermelon.

And the sand between his toes. And in the evening, Katya's fingers and her look of concentration as she painstakingly balmed his sunburnt ears.

[Inside the library, she tells him there is an underground passage leading to the address across the road, but it's a trap]

"Leave the skateboard."

"No, I must return it today."

"Leave it with me. I'll take it back."

She reaches for it, but Lapushkin holds on.

"I am a man of my word. It is my responsibility to return it. I will go to the address now, and later I will go to the shop."

"Suit yourself."

_MAKARIOS: I fear we have lost him, Lord grant rest to his soul._  

_THEOPHANES: Not so fast, my bright young colt. It's too dark, we can't see anything. And if he has indeed been taken, you know very well that his soul will get no rest._  

_MAKARIOS: He didn't make the rendezvous, and he's now in the lair of the Upyr. It's hopeless. There is no time to send someone else._  

_THEOPHANES: Still, I'd like to see it with my own eyes, wouldn't you?_  

_MAKARIOS: What is "it," the body? Don't they eat it?_  

_THEOPHANES: No you fool, just the blood, and sometimes the heart if they're hungry. But yes, the body would satisfy me, or just his absence where we'd expect his presence were he alive._  

_MAKARIOS: I can check later if you still have doubts. Talking of doubts, I have my own. What is our role here Father? Weren't we supposed to guard his soul?_  

_THEOPHANES: To a degree, of course, but please remember your title. We are first and foremost Observers. Other Orders must take responsibility for this particular loss. It is a division of labour ordained by the Lord._

_MAKARIOS: Right now, I find I am questioning whether we have correctly interpreted His plan._

_THEOPHANES: Right now, I need a drink. Care for one?_  

_MAKARIOS: Go on then, you've twisted my arm._

Patient reader, we had better clear something up for you. Despite the fears of our good monks, Lapushkin has not in fact died.

What happens is this. Lapushkin smashes his attacker over the head with the skateboard and runs along the tunnel into complete darkness. His instinct for self-preservation overcomes the vertigo of running without vision, but he takes the precaution of reaching out in front, and soon enough his fingertips crash painfully into stone. He feels around and finds steps going up.

[He manages to cut TL's head off, which destroys her, but maybe not permanently]

He mounts the skateboard and heads East. He is getting the hang of it now.

§ § §

Lapushkin has chosen a window seat on the the right side of the plane so that he can see the Zhiguli mountains during the descent. But they are no more than hills to him now. Maybe Timur had been right. Timur used to annoy everyone in geography class, including the teacher, by insisting that they were not mountains at all, that if they wanted to see mountains they ought to go to the Altai and the Tien Shan. Timur had not been to those places but his father had. Lapushkin has now been to those places --- and to the Caucasus, the Alps, the Andes and the Rockies --- and sees that Timur had had a point.

At the airport he calls Katya to tell her he has landed and that he will see her in half an hour. He tells her to open a window and hang some garlic around the door. She laughs and tells him he is crazy, but he insists.

We shall end it there. It pleases us, and it no doubt pleases you, dear reader, that Lapushkin's soul is saved on this occasion, but whether or not he remains untouched by the agents of Satan in Holy Rus is technically not our jurisdiction, although we trust that he is much safer there, local folk practices having a good track record of protecting the people from unclean spirits (and critics say we are intolerant of paganism!). 

That said, unconfirmed reports do attest that the couple went on to be happy and fruitful in a log cabin with its own forest of birch, pine, and oak, and a view over the river to the Zhiguli mountains, if they are indeed mountains.

[That is all very nice, but just for the sake of completion, we end with a message from Trainee Librarian. It came to light quite recently, and we find it quite moving, even if inconsequential:]

_I began to love you from the moment you stepped out of the shadows to kill Lapushkin. It was your way of moving, like a reconfiguration of ancient megaliths. Your movements had a steady grace, and it was as if you were correcting a cosmic injustice. Because you, alone among men, possessed the knowledge to judge. It was as if the world, stately and in its own time, were redressing the wrong that had been done to it._

_How could I resist?_
