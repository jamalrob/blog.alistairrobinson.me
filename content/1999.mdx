**DISPATCH TO THE HOLY CUSTODIAN**  
**SECOND CYCLE**  
**ON THE FEAST OF THE PROCESSION OF THE HOLY CROSS**  
**IN THE YEAR OF OUR LORD 1999**  

Further to our reports concerning the disappearances of Russian nationals in the vicinity of the Consulate of the Russian Federation, Glasgow, we present here a supporting narrative distillation based on our own supervisory oversight, specifically regarding the case of Ivanov. We ask that any prideful exercise of poetic license herein be met with the esteemed recipient's gracious understanding.

For context we shall interpolate several excerpts from the record of conversations between the two Observers who worked on the case, Hieromonk Theophanes and Novice Makarios. We hope this will shed light on the operation's failures and more generally on the privation of monastic commitment and decorum in the earthly Brotherhoods.

§

_BROTHER OBSERVER MAKARIOS: Where is Father Georgy? Wasn't he supposed to meet Ivanov and get him to the church safely?_  

_FATHER OBSERVER THEOPHANES: Be quiet please, Brother. I'm seeing a disturbance, and our Ivanov is heading straight for it._

_MAKARIOS: I can't see anything._

_THEOPHANES: What a surprise._

_MAKARIOS: I just think I'd be able to do a better job if I knew what was going on. Did you send that bulletin yesterday?_

_THEOPHANES: Your dedication is an inspiration to us all, Brother._

_MAKARIOS: Respectfully Father, what I am wanting is a straight answer._  

_THEOPHANES: Oh, you are wanting all right. Wanting in patience, for one thing._  

_MAKARIOS: You don't have to put up with me, you know. I would be happy, blissfully so in fact, to ask for reassignment. I want very much to get on with the job._  

_THEOPHANES: Again, you want. Want want want want want._  

_MAKARIOS: Respectfully Father, might I ask if you are quite secure in your understanding of the concept of mentorship? From whom can I learn but you?_  

_THEOPHANES: Permit me to suggest a mutually beneficial arrangement. I shall impart to you with good grace the secrets of the Brotherhood, and you shall, one: endeavour to conceal your spectacular talent for irksomeness; and two: adorn your endless Respectfully Fathers with some actual respect._  

_MAKARIOS: Seems reasonable._  

_THEOPHANES: Now, kindly keep your eyes to your Sightglass and allow me to do likewise._

_MAKARIOS: Thank you, Father. Your generosity of spirit stirs me beyond words._

§

And here he is: Ivanov, wandering in quiet business district streets. It is getting close to the close of the twentieth century. It is mostly empty buildings and empty corner cafés, all closed, because it is Sunday in the business district. It has been hot and dry like this for many days, and the as-yet unswept and unhosed working week's dust rises and falls with the tabloid pages and bus tickets in the street-funneled breezes, golden where caught in chinks of sunlight admitted by gaps up high.

But look: here is an anomalous shop, anomalously open for business, its door wide open to the street. A skateshop, selling skateboards, parts, accessories and apparel --- a natural configuration. A shop, then, which is anomalous in context but in itself coherent, thus resting within the order appointed by Christ Himself.

And listen: they are playing aggressive rock music, which echoes off the street's high walls of glass and polished cladding, the sound's waves unscattered by traffic and undamped by pedestrians. Ivanov, buffeted by them, his memory in turn nudged awake by this buffeting, now remembers the scrap of paper in his shorts pocket, and is no longer wandering. With singular purpose, he enters.

Meet the two men within: Angus Boardman and Donald Sawyer. Young Sawyer is sawing to the rhythm of the music through a short thick plank of timber, which is clamped to the counter. Boardman, a moderately older man on the staff side of the counter, is grinning and watching Sawyer.

Now look closer: What neither Ivanov nor our Observers have seen is that there is also a young woman in the shop, browsing (though she is no more of a skater than Ivanov). She is dressed unseasonably in an overcoat several sizes too big for her slight frame. She stares at Ivanov from behind a display, as alert and furtive as a weasel. 

Boardman turns off the music, and Sawyer stops sawing. They watch Ivanov as he walks up to the counter.

"Lost?" says Boardman.

"Good day. You are very perceptive."  

"Well, my foreign friend, you're no skater, that's for sure."  

"Yes, I am hoping you can help me. I would like to know where is this address. It is a church of the Orthodox faith. I know it is near the Russian Consulate, but I do not know where that is."  

He shows the scrap of paper to Boardman, who reads it and frowns, shakes his head, and passes it to Sawyer, who reads it and nods.

"It's hard to get to."  

"Perhaps you can write down the directions."  

"Nah, I'd have to show you. I'm going that way in a minute, but I'll be on my board, otherwise you could tag along."  

"I could run."  

"In flip-flops? I don't think so."  

Boardman says hold on, goes to another room, and returns with an old skateboard.

"You can borrow this. The deck's seen better days, but the rest is solid."  
  
"Oh, are you sure?"  
  
"I know an honest man when I see one." 

Boardman turns over the board to reveal the wheels, and says, "Look, low trucks so it's nice and stable."  
  
"That is ideal, as I am a novice."  
  
"You want a helmet? Pads?"  
  
"No, I will take the risks."  
  
"Have it back by five thirty. Shred it bro," Boardman says, and laughs, looking to Sawyer for approval. He is laughing at Ivanov's expense, and yet there is no malice in it.

Sawyer laughs too, while he gathers up the plank of wood, the saw, and the clamp, puts them in a backpack, and grabs his board.

Out on the street, they mount the boards and head West.

§

_MAKARIOS: How do I ---_

_THEOPHANES: He's moving faster now, so you have to continuously refocus. That's it. Not bad. Your progress may be slow, but it is undeniably detectable._

_MAKARIOS: Entirely owing to your solicitous guidance, Father._  

_THEOPHANES: Watch. The zone of disturbance hasn't followed them, which means this skateboard fellow is harmless._  

_MAKARIOS: Must have been the other guy. Better send a bulletin._  

_THEOPHANES: Oh, Makarios, what am I to do with you? Consider that spiritual disturbances emanate from places and things as much as from people, that there might have been people in the back rooms of the shop, and that there are dozens of floors above the shop, containing who knows how many people._

_MAKARIOS: It's just empty offices._

_THEOPHANES: It is worse than merely impertinent for a servant of the Lord to lay claim to omniscience. The Sightglass is limited, and we do not know that the offices are entirely empty. My point stands: certainty remains elusive. Ivanov is by no means out of the woods yet._
  
§

The surface is smooth, but Ivanov has never been on a skateboard and struggles to keep up and stay on. He is going as fast as he can, but Sawyer continues to recede into the distance ahead.

The business district comes to an end at the edge of a wide urbanized ravine. Although the ground drops away, and the road curves down on stilts into the sprawling highway interchange that occupies the depths below, Ivanov aims toward Heaven. For Sawyer ahead has just crested a parabolic reinforced concrete footbridge, which traverses the great gap with the help of only two slender piers.

Ivanov in this period of his soul's endangerment often suffers from both vertigo and sensory overload. On the vertiginous bridge, a sublimely terrifying view begins to open up around and below. He feels like he is flying, which for him is not as pleasant as it might seem to us.

Descending now, Ivanov feels like he is falling, out of control on his skateboard and gathering speed towards the West End streets.

Sawyer is waiting on the sidewalk, smiling. Further along the street, the flag of the Russian Federation reveals the location of the consulate.

"Looks like you had a rough ride."

"It is nothing. This is the address?"
  
"Down the alley there, through the tunnel to the courtyard, and through the passage on the right to another courtyard. That's where the church is, I think, pretty much behind the consulate."

"I appreciate your help."
  
"I know that girl, by the way."
  
"Which girl?"
  
"The one in the shop."
  
"I did not see anyone."
  
"She was staring at you the whole time. She gives me the creeps. Sounds weird but I think she's living across the road there, in the library."
  
"Well, I must visit the church now."
  
"Say hi to Jesus for me."
  
"Thank you again."
  
Sawyer mounts his board and continues West. Laughing, he shakes his head and shouts to the street, "Shred it bro!" 

Ivanov walks down the alley. Lying on the cobbles at the entrance to the tunnel is a broken box with small Orthodox icons spilling out of it. One of them catches his eye, a reproduction of Our Lady of Kazan, depicting the Mother of God with Christ as a tiny man standing to her left. He bends down to pick it up.

"Don't touch that, it's dirty."

A woman's voice from the street behind him. He stands up straight and looks round.

"Please come back to the street," she says.
  
"I do not understand."
  
"I saw you in the shop and have something to say to you. There is nothing down there. You can have no business there."
  
"But there is a church here, no?"
  
"No, there is nothing. Come out of the alley and back to the street."
  
"I am sorry, but I cannot."

"Then just come here and let me talk to you for a minute. Please."

"All right, if it will make you happy."

As he returns to the street, she stands there biting her fingernails, her eyes unwaveringly fixed on him, somehow simultaneously coy and impatient.

§

_THEOPHANES: It's her._

_MAKARIOS: Are you sure?_

_THEOPHANES:_

_MAKARIOS: She does look weird, I have to admit. Well, since Father Georgy hasn't turned up, couldn't we get a message to the priest at the church?_

_THEOPHANES: Father Alexei is not an Intercessor, Brother. You know the rules. Anyway, he's busy tending his flock, small though it is. There's still time for Father Georgy to appear, and we must trust in his plan, whatever it is._

_MAKARIOS: We don't even know if he has one. Can't you request a direct intervention?_

_THEOPHANES: And by direct you mean..._

_MAKARIOS: Yes._

_THEOPHANES: Your naiveté is almost endearing. These days, we and the Intercessors are the standard manifestation of angelic intervention. Only once in a hundred years do they take things into their own hands._

_MAKARIOS: I have a bad feeling about this, Father._

§

"Your knee is bleeding," says the woman.
  
"Oh, yes. I fell from the skateboard."
  
"You must get it cleaned. Come over to the library with me and I will do it for you."
  
"I am not certain it is a good idea."
  
"There is a lot of blood. You will have an infection. Come. It won't take long."
  
She takes hold of his arm, leads him across the road and then around the base of the steps that sweep down from a colonnaded portico stained by soot and black algae. Still clutching his arm, she scurries down a flight of smaller, meaner steps descending to basement level, and then along a mossy sunken passage to the corner of the edifice. Here, the foliage of a blackthorn tree hides a neglected door, where she releases him and rummages for the key in the pocket of her overcoat.

Inside, it is as cold as a cave, and the air is rancid. Something scuttles to a nook. He follows her along a corridor and into a small room. Light from a frosted window in the adjoining toilet room dimly illuminates a folding bed in a mouldy corner and piles of clothes and books on the floor.

"You live here? Why?"

"Other parts of the library have cameras now, and nobody comes down here."

"But why do you live in a library?"

"Why not? Sit down there and I'll get some stuff for your knee."

She nods in the direction of an orange plastic stackable chair, and Ivanov does as he is told.

As she heads for the door, Ivanov says, "You sound Russian. _Vy russkiy? Ukrainets?_"

She turns and stares at him. Her white face, with crimson lips and bloodshot eyes, seems to float in the air, unnaturally bright in the murk.

"Just wait there."

She goes out and closes the door behind her. Now that Ivanov is left alone with his thoughts, it is a good time to take a peek into his soul. That is what this is all about, after all.

He looks down at his bare arm, where she held him. He does not know if he can really still feel the physical traces (a burning cold and a persistent deformation of the flesh) or if the mental impression left by her touch is so strong that he merely imagines he can --- or if there is any difference. He thinks about the last time he felt a woman's hand on his body. He was back home, sitting on a beach on the Samara Bend after a swim, when Katya came up behind him, touched his wet shoulder, and gave him a two-handed wedge of watermelon.

And the sand between his toes. And in the evening, Katya's look of concentration as she balmed his sunburnt ears with beeswax.

§

_MAKARIOS: Father, I'm having trouble seeing inside._

_THEOPHANES: On this occasion, it is not just you. She has performed an enchantment on the building to hide it from the eyes of God, which in this case means us._

_MAKARIOS: Magic spells? That stuff is real?_

_THEOPHANES: Of course. Any tradition surviving for millennia contains some genuine wisdom._

_MAKARIOS: Then I fear we have lost him. Lord grant rest to his soul._  

_THEOPHANES: Again, you are too quick. We can't see anything, so we do not know. And if he has indeed been taken, you know very well that his soul will be getting no rest._  

_MAKARIOS: He is in her lair. It's hopeless._  

_THEOPHANES: I also fear the worst, Brother, but still, I'd like to see with my own eyes, wouldn't you?_  

_MAKARIOS: See what, his body? Don't they eat it?_  

_THEOPHANES: Usually just the blood, and sometimes the heart if they're hungry. But no, I mean we need confirmation from his absence where we'd expect his presence were he alive._

_MAKARIOS: What?_

_THEOPHANES: If he fails to reappear outside the building in the next few hours, we can conclude with some justification that he is lost. But let us pray for him, Brother._  

_MAKARIOS: Pray for what, though? You already said direct intervention is out. Father, I don't like it. What is our role here? Weren't we supposed to guard his soul?_  

_THEOPHANES: To a degree, of course, but please remember your title. We are the Observers. We observed, and we sent our bulletins. It's up to the Intercessors now. It is a division of labour ordained by the Lord._

_MAKARIOS: Right now, I find I am questioning whether we have correctly interpreted His plan._

_THEOPHANES: Right now, I find I am needing a drink. There's nothing to see at the moment. Care for one?_  

_MAKARIOS: Go on then, you've twisted my arm._  

§

Ivanov hears her approaching. The door opens a fraction, and for a moment there is silence. She is watching him from the corridor, holding her breath. It is a matter of only a few seconds, but time has become distended, an abyssal dream of temporality. She enters.

But it is not her, not exactly. Her bitten-down nails are now bony hooks. Her bloodshot eyes have become milky globes set in pus. In place of her red mouth there is a gaping orifice, where the tongue writhes in a sheath of slime behind pointed teeth.

Ludicrously, she is still wearing the overcoat, now spotted with fresh suppurations.

"I love you."

It is her voice in his head, now a relict utterance from an age before language.

She charges.

As if he is a spectator, Ivanov finds he is using the skateboard as a shield against her claws. He deflects the first grasping strike, springs to his feet and pushes her back with full force. She falls to the floor and squirms to right herself. While she is vulnerable, he swings the skateboard up and back, but before he can bring it down on her head she pounces with a demented swiftness. She is going for his exposed chest, fangs poised to penetrate him and rip out his heart.

But then her body begins to jerk incomprehensibly. Someone is beating it. Ivanov thinks he might be doing it himself without being aware of it. 

"Gimme some help!"

The voice of a fellow human being, it snaps him out of his detachment. It is Sawyer, smashing the creature with his skateboard. The strikes are wild, not all of them effective. She fights back, flailing and lunging.

Ivanov joins Sawyer in the assault, swinging down the edge of his skateboard's deck, hacking at her body. She screams and retreats, but they advance and attack harder. The rhythm of their alternating blows builds to a frenzy, and she falls to the floor. They look at each other and grin, intoxicated with hate and the camaraderie of killing.

She looks up at Ivanov.

"I love you," sounds the primeval voice in his head.

He drops the skateboard and picks up the plastic chair, then drives one of the metal legs down into her skull.

She goes silent and limp.

"What the fuck is it?" says Sawyer.

"The girl. I think she is an Upyr."

"What the fuck is an oo-peer?"

"Like a vampire. My grandmother taught me about them. We must cut off the head."

"Jesus."

"If we do not, the unclean spirit can leave this body and enter another."

The creature is still moving, contracting into a foetal position with a series of residual spasms. Sawyer opens his backpack and brings out the saw.

"Here, this should do it."

Ivanov finds the beheading more physically demanding than he expects. Sawyer, more skilled with the saw, has to take over before Ivanov has even reached the vertebrae. But Sawyer himself struggles with the task, the saw being ill-suited to cut through cartilage, bone, and stiffening muscle.

When it is done, Ivanov covers the corpse, head, and saw (which Sawyer has decided not to keep) with the blanket from the folding bed. 

"I must go to the church now," says Ivanov. "Perhaps the priest will know what to do."

"I'll come with you."


As they walk down the alley towards the tunnel, Ivanov asks, "Why did you come back?"

"I looked around and saw you with her. Something didn't seem right, I dunno. Came to see you were okay."


Later, Ivanov mounts his battered, bloody skateboard, and heads East. It still runs smoothly enough, and he is getting the hang of it now. He has plenty of time to get back to the skateshop.

§

_THEOPHANES: One of us should be watching._

_MAKARIOS: Don't worry old man, there was no sign of him last time I looked. Have another drink!_

_THEOPHANES: Brother, you forget yourself. You are drunk._

_MAKARIOS: No more than you are, Father. The whole thing's over anyway. The vampire bitch made a banquet of his body, gobbled down his heart and had his balls for dessert!_

_THEOPHANES: Enough of that. Ivanov's passing is not an occasion for gleeful vulgarity. And keep your voice down. I'm the one who will get in trouble with the Igumen. By the way, don't call it a vampire. An Upyr isn't quite the same thing._

_MAKARIOS: Oh here we go. Theo ... Theopopadopoulos the Sage, regale us with your pagan lore! No wait, let me do it. Upyrs only drink Slavic blood, right?_

_THEOPHANES: They prefer it, certainly. That's why we're on this case. What else?_

_MAKARIOS: Sunlight? Yes, they don't mind a bit of sunbathing now and then, unlike those delicate Western ones._

_THEOPHANES: I don't know if Hungary and Romania count as Western, but yes, another point for Makarios. Resounding applause. What else?_

_MAKARIOS:_

_THEOPHANES: Brother?_

_MAKARIOS: I've forgotten. I don't feel well, Father. I think have to leave now. I shall go to my, uh, repose, with God's blessing._

_THEOPHANES: Well and good. Oh and don't bother with Midnight Office tonight. I'll tell them you're ill. Go with God, Brother. But pass me that bottle first._

NOTE: Later that day we received a bulletin from Father Theophanes affirming that Ivanov had been killed. Obviously, this was a suppositional assertion made without observational confirmation. It hardly needs to be said that this, among many other things, represents a serious dereliction of duty. Father Observer Theophanes and Brother Observer Makarios, who were quickly replaced, are presently undergoing re-training.

§

On his flight from Moscow to Samara, Ivanov has chosen a window seat on the right side of the plane so he can see the Zhiguli mountains during the descent. But they are no more than hills to him now. Maybe Timur was right. Timur used to annoy everyone in geography class, including the teacher, by insisting that they were not mountains at all, that if they wanted to see mountains they ought to go to the Altai and the Tien Shan. Timur had not been to those places but his father had. Ivanov has now been to those places --- and to the Caucasus, the Alps, the Andes and the Rockies --- and sees that Timur had a point.

At the airport he calls Katya to say he has landed and that he will see her in an hour. He tells her to open a window and hang some garlic around the door. She laughs and says he is crazy, but he insists.

**CONCLUSION**

We give praise that Ivanov's soul was safeguarded on this occasion. Whether or not he shall remain untouched by the agents of the deceitful one is not for us to speculate. It is true that there are signs of a growth in demonic activity in Holy Rus, but we trust in the vitality of the faithful and the locally excellent track record of folkloric protection against unclean spirits (and critics say we are intolerant of paganism!). 

We shall not take liberties with our role by attempting a full divination, but all indications are that the couple will go on to be happy and fruitful in a log cabin within a forest of birch and pine, with Our Lady of Kazan placed over the cradle of their child and a view across the river to the Zhiguli mountains, if they are indeed mountains.

We regret that we cannot end on that happy note. This is not a time for complacency. Owing to our swift action on receiving the news from Father Alexei, proper disposal of the Upyr was ensured, but the operation is ongoing. A clean-up team combining Intercessors, Sanctifiers, and lay guardians was put in place immediately and is taking the work to completion in accordance with the latest supplement to the Manuals of Ritual (See appendix). It is expected that new evidence will conclusively establish that the missing Russian nationals were victims of the Upyr; recovering their remains is the current priority. Though slim, the possibility that these victims have themselves become Upyrs cannot be ruled out.

_NOTE: Hieromonk Georgy, who we later discovered was making an unauthorized pilgrimage to Cyprus during the events discussed, is no longer working as a field operative. Donald Sawyer, though not a member of the community of the faithful, nor even of Slavic ancestry, is presently lending his assistance in the role of lay guardian._

Taking a wider view, it is clear that there is much work for us ahead. The end of the Soviet Union has been a mixed blessing. Foreign travel from the region has grown and will continue to do so, with the result that East Slavs will increasingly be exposed --- without the effective syncretic protections operative in their homeland --- to those Slavic minions of Lucifer who remain in exile. We must remain vigilant lest the children of Holy Rus go the way of their heterodox Western cousins.

There are matters demanding more immediate action. The shocking series of failures and improprieties apparent in our earthly institutions must be addressed. We recommend a root cause analysis following discussion at the forthcoming Assembly.

By the grace of Heaven, may this report serve in the ongoing protection of the faithful, entrusted to Your vigilance.

In Service and Humility,  
Orphiel, Senior Overseer, Observation and Intervention (UK)

**APPENDIX: Proper Destruction and Disposal of an Upyr**

Folklore being what it is, there are various myths surrounding this topic. We have established the correct procedure, and we include it here for convenience; it can also be found in the Manuals of Ritual.

Once the creature has been incapacitated by the ordinary methods, the following points must be observed:

Options for destruction:

1. Decapitation.
2. Wooden stake through the heart. Contrary to the legends, the type of wood is unimportant: any sturdy pointed wooden shaft will do.
3. Drowning.*

* WARNING: USE DROWNING ONLY IF THE CORPSE CAN BE RETRIEVED FOR DISPOSAL

Options for disposal:

1. Bury the corpse securely nailed down in a coffin, applying holy water inside and out. For instances of decapitation, first place the head between the legs, facing down.
2. Burn the corpse and bury the ashes in an unmarked pit.
