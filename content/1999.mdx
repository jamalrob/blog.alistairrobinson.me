**SECOND CYCLE**  
**FEAST OF THE PROCESSION OF THE HOLY CROSS, 1999**  
**FOR INTERNAL USE ONLY**

Further to our reports concerning the disappearance of Russian nationals in the vicinity of the Consulate of the Russian Federation, we present here a supporting narrative distillation based on our own supervisory oversight, specifically regarding the case of Lapushkin. I ask that the reader forgive any prideful exercise of poetic licence to be found herein.

For context we shall interpolate several excerpts from the record of conversations between the two Observers who worked on the case. This might additionally shed some light on the operation's failures and more generally on the privation of monastic decorum and commitment in the expatriate divisions of the Order.

§ § §

_BROTHER OBSERVER MAKARIOS: Where is Father Georgiy? Wasn't he supposed to meet Lapushkin and get him to the church safely?_  

_FATHER OBSERVER THEOPHANES: Be quiet please, Brother. I'm seeing a disturbance, and Lapushkin is heading straight for it._

_MAKARIOS: I can't see anything._

_THEOPHANES: What a surprise._

_MAKARIOS: I just think I'd be able to do a better job if I knew what was going on. Did you send that update yesterday?_

_THEOPHANES: Your dedication is an inspiration to us all, Brother._

_MAKARIOS: Respectfully Father, what I am wanting is a straight answer._  

_THEOPHANES: Oh, you are wanting all right. Wanting in patience, for one thing._  

_MAKARIOS: You don't have to put up with me, you know. I would be happy, blissfully so in fact, to ask for reassignment. I want very much to get on with the job._  

_THEOPHANES: Again, you want. Want want want want want._  

_MAKARIOS: Respectfully Father, might I ask if you are quite secure in your understanding of the concept of mentorship? From whom can I learn but you?_  

_THEOPHANES: Permit me to suggest a mutually beneficial arrangement. I shall impart to you with good grace the secrets of the Order, and you shall, one: endeavour to conceal your spectacular talent for irksomeness; and two: adorn your endless Respectfully Fathers with some actual respect._  

_MAKARIOS: Seems reasonable._  

_THEOPHANES: Now, kindly focus on observing Lapushkin and allow me to do likewise._

_MAKARIOS: Thank you, Father. Your generosity of spirit stirs me beyond words._

§ § §

And here he is: Lapushkin, wandering in quiet business district streets. It is getting close to the close of the twentieth century. It is mostly empty buildings and empty corner cafés, all closed, because it is Sunday in the business district. It has been hot and dry like this for many days, and the as-yet unswept and unhosed working week's dust rises and falls with the tabloid pages and bus tickets in the street-funneled breezes, golden where caught in chinks of sunlight admitted by gaps up high.

But look: here is an anomalous shop, anomalously open for business, its door wide open to the street. A skateshop, selling skateboards, parts, and accessories --- a natural configuration. A shop, then, which is anomalous in context but is in itself coherent, thus resting within the order appointed by Christ Himself.

And listen: they are playing fast aggressive rock music, which echoes loud off the street's high walls of polished stone cladding and glass, the sound's waves unscattered by traffic and undamped by pedestrians. Lapushkin, buffeted by them, his memory in turn nudged awake by this buffeting, now remembers the scrap of paper in his shorts pocket, and is no longer wandering. With a singular purpose, he enters.

Meet the two men within: Skateshop Manager and Sawyer. Sawyer, a young man on the customer side of the counter, is sawing to the rhythm of the music through a short thick plank of timber, which is clamped to the counter. Skateshop Manager, a moderately older man on the staff side of the counter who has been grinning and watching Sawyer, watches Sawyer again and grins again after having glanced at Lapushkin ungrinningly.

What neither Lapushkin nor our Observers will discover is that there is also a young woman in the shop, browsing among the wheels: Trainee Librarian. She is dressed unseasonally in an overcoat some sizes too big for her slight frame. She stares at Lapushkin from behind a display, as alert and furtive as a weasel. 

The music stops. Sawyer stops sawing and stares at Lapushkin. Skateshop Manager speaks.

"Lost?"  

"Good day. You are very perceptive."  

"Well, you're no skater."  

"I want to know where is this address. I know it is near the Russian Consulate, but I do not know where that is."  

He shows the scrap of paper to Skateshop Manager, who reads and frowns, reads and frowns, shakes his head and shakes his head and passes it to Sawyer, who reads it and nods.

"It's hard to get to."  

"Perhaps you can write down the directions."  

"Nah, I'd have to show you. I'm going that way in a minute, but I'll be on my board."  

"I could run."  

"In flip-flops? I don't think so."  

Skateshop Manager says hold on, goes to another room, and returns with an old skateboard.

"You can borrow this. The deck's seen better days, but the rest is solid."  
  
"You are very kind, but only if you are certain."  
  
"It's got low trucks so it's nice and stable."  
  
"That sounds ideal, as I am a novice."  
  
"You want a helmet? Pads?"  
  
"No, I will take the risks."  
  
"Have it back by five thirty. Shred it bro."  

Skateshop Manager laughs, and Sawyer laughs too while he gathers up the plank of wood, the saw, and the clamp, puts them in a backpack, and grabs his board.

Out on the street, they mount the boards and head West. The surface is smooth, but Lapushkin has never been on a skateboard and struggles to keep up and stay on. He is going as fast as he can, but Sawyer continues to recede into the distance ahead.

§ § §

_THEOPHANES: He's moving quickly, so you have to continuously refocus. That's it, you're doing quite well. About time._

_MAKARIOS: Entirely owing to your solicitous guidance, Father. Anyway, look. He's heading West._  

_THEOPHANES: Into a bright future, I hope. The zone of disturbance hasn't followed them, which means this skateboard fellow is harmless._  

_MAKARIOS: Must have been the other guy. Better send an update._  

_THEOPHANES: Oh, Makarios, what am I to do with you? Consider that spiritual disturbances emanate from places and things as much as from people, that there might have been other people in the back rooms of the shop, and that there are dozens of floors above the shop, containing who knows how many people._

_MAKARIOS: It's just empty offices._

_THEOPHANES: It is worse than merely impertinent for a servant of the Lord to claim omniscience. We do not know that the offices are entirely empty. My point stands: certainty remains elusive. Lapushkin is by no means out of the woods yet. Once he's in the church and under the protection of Father Ivan, we can relax._
  
§ § §

The business district comes to an end at the edge of a wide urbanized ravine. Although the ground drops away, and the road curves down on stilts into the sprawling highway interchange that occupies the depths below, Lapushkin heads for Heaven. For Sawyer has just crested a shallowly parabolic reinforced concrete footbridge, which elegantly traverses the great gap with the help of only two slender piers.

As the reader may already know from previous dispatches and epistolary reports, Lapushkin in this period of his soul's endangerment often suffers from both vertigo and sensory overload. On the vertiginous bridge, a sublimely terrifying view begins to open up around and below. He feels like he is flying, which for him is not as pleasant as it might seem to us.

[There used to be a river in this canyon, supporting a brewery, a distillery, a barley mill, and workers' terraces. The buildings and their occupants were destroyed, but the river is still there, although you cannot see it or reach it.]

Descending now, Lapushkin feels like he is falling, out of control on his skateboard and gathering speed towards the West End streets.


Sawyer is waiting on the sidewalk, smiling. Further along the street the flag of the Russian Federation reveals the location of the consulate.

"Looks like you had a rough ride."

"It is nothing. This is the address?"
  
"Down the alley there, through the tunnel to the courtyard, and through the passage on the right to another courtyard. That's where the church is, I think, pretty much behind the consulate."

"I appreciate your help."
  
"I know that girl, by the way."
  
"Which girl?"
  
"The one in the shop who was staring at you."
  
"I did not see anyone."
  
"She was there all right. She gives me the creeps. Sounds weird but I think she's living across the road there, in the library."
  
"Well, I must visit the church now."
  
"Say hi to Jesus for me."
  
"Thank you again."
  
Sawyer mounts his board and continues West. Laughing, he shakes his head and shouts to the street, "Shred it bro!" 

Lapushkin enters the alley and makes for the tunnel. On the ground, in amongst the nettles and dandelions which have grow through the cracks in the paving, is a broken box with garish plastic Orthodox icons spilling out of it. He bends down to pick one up, [describe it]

"Where are you going?"

A voice from the street behind him. It is Trainee Librarian, who has seen him on her way to the library.

"I need to visit this address."
  
"There is nothing there. Please come back to the street."
  
"Why?"
  
"Please. There is nothing there. You can have no business there."
  
"But I have an appointment here."
  
"There is nothing there. Come out of the alley and back to the street."
  
"I am sorry, but I cannot."

"Then just come here and let me talk to you for a minute. Please."

"All right, if it will make you happy."

As he returns to the street, her ashen face is unwaveringly fixed on him. 

§ § §

_THEOPHANES: It's her._

_MAKARIOS: Are you sure?_

_THEOPHANES: It's her all right._

_MAKARIOS: She does look weird, I have to admit. Since Father Georgiy hasn't turned up, couldn't we get a message to Father Ivan at the church?_

_THEOPHANES: He is not an Intercessor, Brother. You know the rules. In any case, he's busy tending his flock._

_MAKARIOS: Well, can't you request a direct interevention?_

_THEOPHANES: Your naiveté is almost endearing. These days, we and the Intercessors are the standard manifestation their intervention. Only once in a hundred years do they take things into their own hands._

§ § §

"Your knee is bleeding," says Trainee Librarian.
  
"Oh, yes. I fell from the skateboard."
  
"You should get it cleaned. Come over to the library with me and I'll get it fixed up."
  
"But you do not know me."
  
"Come. It won't take long."
  
She takes hold of his arm, leads him across the road and then around the base of the steps that flow down from a colonnaded stone portico stained by soot and black algae. Still clutching his arm, she scurries down a flight of smaller, meaner steps descending to basement level and then along a mossy sunken passage to the corner of the edifice. Around this corner the loaded foliage of a crab apple tree hides a neglected door, where she releases him and rummages for the key in the roomy pocket of her ridiculous overcoat.

Inside, it is as cold as a cave. He follows her along an unhealthy corridor and into a small room. Light from a frosted window in the adjoining toilet room dimly illuminates a camp bed in one corner, an electric heater in another, and books piled up on the floor all over.

"Why do you live here?"

"Other parts of the library have cameras now, and nobody comes down here."

"No, I beg your pardon, I mean why do you live in the library?"

"Why not? Sit down there and I'll get some stuff for your knee."

She nods in the direction of an orange plastic stackable chair, and Lapushkin does as he is told. As she heads for the door, Lapushkin speaks.

"Are you Russian?"

She turns and stares at him, her bone-white face, with crimson lips and blooshot eyes, seeming to float, disembodied and unnaturally bright in the murk.

"Just wait there."

Trainee Librarian leaves the room. Now that Lapushkin is just sitting there doing nothing, it is a good time to take a peek into his soul. We have not forgotten about it. That is what this is all about, after all.

He looks down at his bare arm, where she held him. He does not know if he can really still feel the physical traces --- a burning cold and a persistent deformation of the flesh --- or if the mental impression left by her touch is so strong that he merely imagines he can, or if there is any difference. He thinks about the last time he felt a woman's hand on his body. He was back home, lying on a beach on the Samara Bend after a swim, when Katya came up behind him, touched his wet shoulder, and handed him a massive slice of watermelon.

And the sand between his toes. And in the evening, Katya's fingers and her expression of concentration as she painstakingly balmed his sunburnt ears with beeswax.

[She returns, fixes his knee? and somehow eventually gets him to go down to the sub-basement, and then reveals her true form and begins to attack]

§ § §

_MAKARIOS: I can't see anything._

_THEOPHANES: It's not just you. She has performed an enchantment on the library to hide it from the eyes of God, which in this case means us._

_MAKARIOS: That stuff is real?_

_THEOPHANES: Sadly, yes. It is a truth universally acknowledged that any tradition surviving for millennia contains some genuine knowledge._

_MAKARIOS: Then I fear we have lost him. Lord grant rest to his soul._  

_THEOPHANES: Again, you are too quick. We can't see anything, so we don't know. And if he has indeed been taken, you know very well that his soul will be getting no rest._  

_MAKARIOS: He is in the lair of the Upyr. It's hopeless._  

_THEOPHANES: I also fear the worst, Brother, but still, I'd like to see with my own eyes, wouldn't you?_  

_MAKARIOS: See what, his body? Don't they eat it?_  

_THEOPHANES: Usually just the blood, and sometimes the heart if they're hungry. But no, I mean we need confirmation from his absence where we'd expect his presence were he alive._

_MAKARIOS: What?_

_THEOPHANES: If he fails to reappear in the next few hours, we can reasonably confirm he is lost. Let us pray for him, Brother._  

_MAKARIOS: Father, I don't like it. What is our role here? Weren't we supposed to guard his soul?_  

_THEOPHANES: To a degree, of course, but please remember your title. We are the Observers. We observed, and we sent our updates. It's up to the Intercessors to, well, intercede. It is a division of labour ordained by the Lord._

_MAKARIOS: Right now, I find I am questioning whether we have correctly interpreted His plan._

_THEOPHANES: Right now, I find I am needing a drink. There's nothing to see at the moment. Care for one?_  

_MAKARIOS: Go on then, you've twisted my arm._  

§ § §

Lapushkin smashes his attacker over the head with the skateboard and runs along the tunnel into complete darkness. His instinct for self-preservation overcomes the vertigo of running without vision, but he takes the precaution of reaching out in front, and soon enough his fingertips crash painfully into stone. He feels around and finds steps going up.

[He manages to cut TL's head off, which destroys her, but maybe not permanently, cos other things have to be done]

[Sawyer comes back to help and Lapushkin uses the saw to cut off the Upyr's head]

He mounts the skateboard and heads East. He is getting the hang of it now.

§ § §

_THEOPHANES: Brother, you are drunk._

_MAKARIOS: No more than you are, Father. The whole thing's over anyway. The vampire bitch made a banquet of his body, gobbled down his heart and had his balls for dessert!_

_THEOPHANES: Enough of that, Makarios. Lapushkin's passing is not an occasion for gleeful vulgarity. And keep your voice down. I'm the one who'll get in trouble with the Abbot. By the way, don't call it a vampire. An Upyr isn't quite the same thing._

_MAKARIOS: Yes yes, here we go. Theopopadopalous the Sage, kindly regale us with your pagan lore! No wait, let me do it. Upyrs only drink Slavic blood._

_THEOPHANES: Obviously. What else?_

_MAKARIOS: Sunlight? They enjoy a bit of sunbathing now and then, unlike those delicate Western weaklings._

_THEOPHANES: I don't know if Hungary and Romania count as Western, but yes, it's another point for Makarios. Resounding applause. And? What else?_

_MAKARIOS: I've forgotten. Sorry Father, I think have to leave now. I may have overindulged. I shall go to my, uh, repose, with God's blessing._

_THEOPHANES: Well and good. The Lord has apparently interceded for your own benefit. Better late than never (forgive me Lord)._

_MAKARIOS: What?_

_THEOPHANES: Never mind. Oh and don't bother with Midnight Office tonight. I'll tell them you're ill. Go with God, Brother. But pass me that bottle first._

NOTE: Later that day we received an update from Father Theophanes affirming that Lapushkin had been killed. This was at best a suppositional assertion, made without observational confirmation. It hardly needs to be said that this, among other things, represents a serious dereliction of duty.

§ § §

Lapushkin has chosen a window seat on the the right side of the plane so that he can see the Zhiguli mountains during the descent. But they are no more than hills to him now. Maybe Timur had been right. Timur used to annoy everyone in geography class, including the teacher, by insisting that they were not mountains at all, that if they wanted to see mountains they ought to go to the Altai and the Tien Shan. Timur had not been to those places but his father had. Lapushkin has now been to those places --- and to the Caucasus, the Alps, the Andes and the Rockies --- and sees that Timur had had a point.

At the airport he calls Katya to tell her he has landed and that he will see her in half an hour. He tells her to open a window and hang some garlic around the door. She laughs and tells him he is crazy, but he insists.

§ § §

It pleases us, and it must please the faithful reader, that Lapushkin's soul was saved on this occasion. Whether or not he shall remain untouched by the agents of Satan is not for us to speculate. It is true that there are indications of an upsurge in demonic activity in Holy Rus, but we trust in the vitality of the faithful and the locally excellent track record of folkloric protection against unclean spirits (and critics say we are intolerant of paganism!). 

We shall not attempt here a divination, but all indications are that the couple will go on to be happy and fruitful in a log cabin in a forest of birch, pine, and oak, with a view over the river to the Zhiguli mountains, if they are indeed mountains.

We regretfully cannot end on that happy note. The end of the Soviet Union has been a mixed blessing. Foreign travel for Russians being likely to increase, they will be increasingly exposed to the exiled Slavic minions of the deceitful one, without the effective protections operating in the homeland. We must remain vigilant lest they go the way of Western Europe.

Of more immediate concern is the shocking series of failures and improprieties in evidence across the organization, particularly among the Orders of Observers and of Intercessors. Crudely put, we --- and of course Lapushkin --- were lucky, and the conspicuous rottenness in our earthly institutions must be addressed. A root cause analysis shall be carried out following the forthcoming Council.

**APPENDIX A: Proper Destruction and Disposal of an Upyr**

Folklore being what it is, there are various myths surrounding this topic. We have established the correct procedure, and we include it here for convenience; it can also be found in the Manuals of Ritual.

Once the creature has been incapacitated by the ordinary methods, the following points must be observed:

Options for destruction:
1. Decapitation
2. Wooden stake through the heart. Contrary to the legends, the type of wood is unimportant: any sturdy pointed wooden shaft will do.
3. Drowning (this simultaneously counts as proper disposal)

NOTE: Combining these is optional, not compulsory.

Options for disposal (when the creature has not been drowned):
1. Bury the corpse securely nailed down in a coffin, then apply holy water. For instances of decapitation, first place the head between the legs, facing down.
2. Burn the corpse and bury the ashes in an unmarked pit.


**APPENDIX B: Intercepted Message from the Upyr**

We were surprised to intercept a message from the creature herself. It was this circumstance that made us realize that she had not been properly destroyed, even though Lapushkin had done more than could have been expected. We rectified this quickly and efficiently.

_I began to love you from the moment I saw you in the skateshop and the deep and complex scent of your blood reached me._

_How could I resist?_
