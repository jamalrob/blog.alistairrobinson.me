The first time Jim woke up in a conifer plantation, not knowing how he got there, was about five years ago. That time, there was a crow on the top of a knoll in the clearing, cawing as raucously as it could manage. When he stirred, the crow bounced away and then up to a perch on the birch tree at the edge of the clearing.

The only sign that it was autumn was a single birch tree at the edge of the clearing with a few leaves still clinging on, like spots of yellow paint on a striated darkness. That and the deep, damp cold.

For Jim, the first sign of an oncoming seizure was always a lacuna just off-centre in his field of vision, obscuring whatever it was he was looking at. This gradually grew in size and developed an internal complexity (had this been there from the start?) Something was moving inside the blank patch, a prism or kaleidoscope of spinning rainbow colours.
