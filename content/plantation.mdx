Jamal woke up in a clearing in a conifer plantation. 

The only obvious sign of autumn was a single birch tree at the edge of the clearing, standing out against the dense conifers, half of its leaves still clinging on, like flecks of gold-yellow paint spattered onto a striated green-black field. That and the deep, damp cold---not the dead and locked-up kind of cold of winter, but the fluid, active cold that flows with the ubiquitous wetness into your shoes and stays there.

It was not the first time Jamal had woken up in a conifer plantation, not knowing how he got there. That had been five years ago. That time, there was a crow on the top of a knoll in the clearing, cawing as raucously as it could manage. When he stirred, the crow bounced away and then up to a perch on the birch tree at the edge of the clearing.

The first sign of an oncoming seizure was, without fail, a lacuna in his field of vision, just off-centre, obscuring whatever it was he was looking at. This would gradually grow in size and develop an internal complexity---or had this been there from the start?---until a moving pattern could be discerned, a prism or kaleidoscope of spinning rainbow colours.
