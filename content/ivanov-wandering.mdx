"Sokolov is wandering."  
"Where?"  
"He wanders."  
"Yes, but where?"  
"Here and there, as they say, I expect."  
"What I am wanting is a straight answer."  
"So you are wanting, are you?"  
"I am."  
"You want."  
"I do."  
 
&nbsp;

Sokolov is wandering in quiet business district streets. It is getting close to the close of the twentieth century. It is mostly empty buildings and empty corner caf√©s, all closed, because it is Sunday in the business district. But look: here is an anomalous shop, anomalously open, its door wide open. It is for skateboarding things. Boards, parts, and accessories --- a natural commercial configuration. And listen: they are playing fast aggressive rock music, which is echoing off the street's high unbroken walls. Sokolov remembers the scrap of paper in his pocket and is no longer wandering. He enters.

Within, a young man on the customer side of the counter is sawing to the compelling rhythm through a short thick plank of timber, which is clamped to the counter. A somewhat older man on the staff side, the proprietor, who has been grinning and watching the sawing man, watches the sawing man again and grins again, after having glanced briefly and ungrinningly at entering Sokolov.

An off-duty trainee librarian, her pleasant browsing interrupted by Sokolov's appearance, rushes past him and out to the street. The music stops. The sawing man stops, pants like a dog, tongue lolling, and stares at Sokolov. The proprietor speaks.

"What do you want? You are not a skateboarder."  
"How can you know this?"  
"I am a skateboarder."  
"I am also."  
"You lie."  
"Okay, yes, you are correct. In fact I just want to know where is this address. It does not seem to be on a map."  

He shows the scrap of paper to the proprietor, who reads and frowns, shakes his head and passes it to the other man, who reads, stops panting, and nods.

"It's hard to get to. I'm going that way, so I can show you. Only thing is I'm on my board so you'll need one too. To keep up."  
"I could run."  
"No."  
"I do not want to buy one."

The proprietor says hold on, goes to another room, and returns with a skateboard.

"You can borrow this. It's solid."  
"Thank you very much, but only if you are certain."  
"It's got low trucks. Pretty stable."  
"That is ideal, since I am a novice."  
"Do you want a helmet? Pads?"  
"No, I will take the risks."  
"Off you go then. Shred it."

He laughs, and the other man laughs too, while he gathers up the plank of wood, the saw, and the clamp, and puts them in a backpack, and grabs his board.

"Let's go."

Out on the street, they mount the boards and head West. The surface is smooth, but Sokolov has never been on a skateboard and struggles to keep up and stay on. Eventually the streets open out to the highway, and they span the junction on the overpass [...]

The man is waiting for him on the sidewalk.

"This is the address?"  
"Yeah, see the alley there. The metal door."  
"It was not difficult to find. You could have given me directions."  
"You wouldn't have found it."  
"I appreciate your help."  
"I know that girl, by the way."  
"Which girl?"  
"The one who left."  
"Oh."  
"She lives across the road there, in the library, but don't tell anyone."  
"I assure you that my mouth will always be closed."  
"She'll be on her way there now."  
"I did not see her."  
"She goes by other ways."  
"I must visit this address now. Goodbye."  
"Good luck mister."

The young man mounts his board and continues West. Sokolov approaches the door, stepping over broken pallets and broken panes of glass.

"Where are you going?"

It is the librarian, who has seen him on her way to the library.

"I need to visit this address."  
"There is nothing there. Please come back to the street."  
"Why?"  
"Please. There is nothing there. You can have no business with them."  
"You live in the library."  
"That bastard! I told him not to tell anyone."  
"Please do not worry. I will not tell anyone."  
"Come out of the alley and back to the street."  
"Okay, I will, if it will make you happy."  
"Your knee is bleeding."  
"Oh."  
"It it from the glass?"  
"No, it must have been when I fell off the skateboard."  
"You are a beginner."  
"Correct."  
"You should get that cleaned up."  
"Can you let me into the library so that I can do so?"

"Sokolov is no longer wandering."  
"I noticed."  
"You finally getting the hang of it, eh?"  
"No thanks to you. Anyway look."  
"Yes, this is a development."  
"He is heading West."  
"Towards a bright future, no doubt."  
"Towards the library. We shall see."
