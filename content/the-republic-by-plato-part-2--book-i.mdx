In this article I'll look at the second half of Book I. This is where the Republic's main antagonist enters the stage: Thrasymachus, unable to contain himself any longer, bursts into the conversation with his impatient, contemptuous rhetoric. When Socrates recovers from the shock, he cross-examines Thrasymachus in his customary style.

Recall the two central questions of the republic:

1. What is justice?  
2. Is the just life more personally beneficial than the unjust life? Or, is the just life _happier_ than the unjust life?

Thrasymachus will have answers:

<aside class="callout">
  <strong><em>Thrasymachus's claims</em></strong>
    <ol>
      <li>Justice is what is advantageous for the stronger (the ruler).</li>
      <li>The just life is <em>not</em> more personally beneficial than the unjust life. On the contrary, it is injustice which is advantageous to oneself.</li>
    </ol>
</aside>

Thus he will offer a definition and a claim about what benefits the agent. As noted, "the stronger" should be understood as _the ruler_. 

I said Thrasymachus was the work's main antagonist, but on a first read this can escape notice, because after Book I he doesn't appear again and is hardly mentioned. This is because he is not the antagonist in the familiar dramatic sense but in a spiritual or conceptual sense: the rest of the work aims to defeat _the position that Thrasymachus represents_, and to do so more comprehensively than Socrates can manage in his direct examination of that position in Book I.

This is the meaning of the structure of the Republic, beginning with the back-and-forth of the Socratic _elenchus_ in Book I, then progressing to an expansive and more positive theoretical exploration in what follows. The failure of Thrasymachus to sustain his position under Socrates's examination is not enough to persuade the others that he is wrong, or rather---given that they probably do believe so intuitively---it is not enough to bring up to the level of consciously articulated knowledge precisely _how_ he is wrong. For that, Socrates needs to present them with a coherent and convincing system against which Thrasymachus's position shows up as false.

Which reminds me of Wittgenstein:

> 141. When we first begin to _believe_ anything, what we believe is not a single proposition, it is a whole system of propositions. (Light dawns gradually over the whole.)
>
> 142. It is not single axioms that strike me as obvious, it is a system in which consequences and premises give one another _mutual_ support.
>
> --- _On Certainty_

Plato knows this, which is why, after Book I, he goes to the effort of carefully painting a picture of his entire conception of the city and the soul.

## Who is Thrasymachus?  

It helps to know who he is, and what he represents for Plato. Thrasymachus was a historical figure, well-known in his time even apart from his immortalization by Plato. He was one of the sophists, a class of freelance intellectuals---professional instructors in public speaking and argument. 

From the point of view of Socrates, the sophists love the sound of their own voices, crafting artfully persuasive or domineering speeches rather than joining a communal effort to search for truth. He sees them as seeking, not truth at all, but _victory_---perhaps inevitable considering they're doing it for money.

Crucially, according to Socrates and Plato, these intellectual vices are the fertile ground for the growth of moral nihilism and relativism. It is no coincidence that Thrasymachus, whose use of argument and speech is merely instrumental, also believes that virtues such as _justice_ are merely instrumental, a cynical means to the ends of power and wealth. Representing a mercenary intellectual tradition, Thrasymachus naturally frames justice as mercenary too.

So he is portrayed as aggressive, contemptuous, eager to speak more than to listen, impatient with the give-and-take of enquiry---and when the argument turns against him, he effectively throws his toys out of the pram, petulantly withdrawing instead of openly yielding rationally.

An admirer of tyrants, he is himself the _intellectual_ tyrant of the Republic. As such, he has a soul which is disordered, like the society ruled by a tyrannical ruler, and Socrates will set out this parallel in depth later on.

## Summary

A preliminary summary will help. The second half of Book I goes like this:

1. Thrasymachus demands to hear Socrates's definition of justice
2. Socrates and the others persuade him to give his own definition (partly by paying him)
3. Thrasymachus claims that ***justice is what serves the interests of the ruling power***. [338b]
4. He argues for this from [338d to 341a](#argument-one).
5. Socrates, by elenchus, challenges his definition and shows him that ruling, considered as a craft, aims at the good of the ruled rather than the ruler. ([341c-342e](#elenchus-one))
6. Thrasymachus offers another argument for his claim. This goes from [343a to 344c](#argument-two).
7. Socrates, by elenchus, turns away from the definition _as such_, to challenge Thrasymachus's claim about benefit and happiness. First he shows that a just person is good and wise, and an unjust one ignorant and bad. This causes Thrasymachus to blush. ([345b-350d](#elenchus-blush))
8. Socrates continues, showing that not only is injustice ignorant and bad, but it doesn't bring happiness or profit either. ([350d-354a](#elenchus-two))

## The dialogue

By the time we get half way through Book I, Socrates has revealed the defectiveness of the definitions of justice offered by Cephalus and then his son Polemarchus:

> SOCRATES: All right. Since it has become apparent, then, that neither justice nor the just consists in benefiting friends and harming enemies, what else should one say it is?

This is when Thrasymachus is introduced, in dramatic fashion:

> _Now, while we were speaking, Thrasymachus had tried many times to take over the discussion but was restrained by those sitting near him, who wanted to hear our argument to the end. When we paused after what I had just said, however, he could not keep quiet any longer: crouched up like a wild beast about to spring, he hurled himself at us as if to tear us to pieces. Polemarchus and I were frightened and flustered as he roared into our midst._
>
> [336a]

This initiates Plato's portrayal of Thrasymachus the sophist as a dangerous character, and dangerous in several ways: 

- In his arrogant and confrontational manner.
- In his mercenary approach to discussion---as we'll see, he refuses to give his account of justice until the others have committed to paying him.
- In the intellectual attitude he represents, that of cynical nihilism and relativism with regard to justice and truth.

He roars into their midst with this speech:

> What nonsense you two have been talking all this time, Socrates! Why do you act like naïve people, giving way to one another? If you really want to know what justice is, don’t just ask questions and then indulge your love of honor by refuting the answers. You know very well it is easier to ask questions than to answer them. Give an answer yourself and tell us what _you_ say the just is.
> 
> [336b]

In this way, Plato draws our attention to a fundamental difference in philosophical approach. Socrates favours questions and dialogue, whereas Thrasymachus favours opinion and speechifying.

Socrates's response prompts Thrasymachus to accuse him of being ironic, and this is an accusation that's been levelled at Socrates ever since, right up to the present day. And it's easy to see why. Phrases such as "Don't be too hard on us," "my friend," and "you clever people" seem ironic in the extreme. However, his emphasis on the seriousness and value of the search for justice is sincere. Thus we have _ironic tone, serious intent_.

But what is the point of the ironic tone? I think it's a subtle combination of provocation and defence, provoking Thrasymachus at the same time as defending against his violence---Socrates faces up to him without, however, meeting him on his own ground, i.e., with violence.

And he carries on in this mode:

> That is because you are a wise fellow, Thrasymachus.
>
> [337a]

Thrasymachus continues to demand Socrates's definition of justice until Socrates turns it around, at 338a. And Thrasymachus obliges:

> THRASYMACHUS: Listen, then. I say justice is nothing other than what is advantageous for the stronger. Well, why don’t you praise me? No, you are unwilling.
>
> [338b]

## Thrasymachus's first argument 

Under pressure from Socrates, at 338d he clarifies that "the stronger" is the ruling power, whether in an aristocracy, a democracy, or a tyranny.


## Is Thrasymachus incoherent?

Some scholars have puzzled over the supposed inconsistency of Thrasymachus's stated views:

1. Justice is the advantage of the stronger.
2. Justice is obedience to the laws.
3. Justice is the advantage of the other.

On the surface, it looks like these cannot all be true. If you are the stronger, then according to (1) justice is to my advantage, but according to (2) it is to the _other's_ advantage. This objection has always struck me as pedantic, and I don't get any sense of incoherence when I read Book I, which suggests to me that Plato did not intend to _portray_ Thrasymachus as incoherent. 

What the above statements hide is that the claims are indexical, indexed to the agent's standpoint, where the agent is assumed not to be the ruler. The presupposition is that _the stronger_ and _the other_ are identical. The discussion is about what is best from one's own point of view as the person who is acting justly, so _the stronger_ means _the one who is stronger than oneself_. So, to act justly is to act to the advantage of who is more powerful than oneself, which is of course simultaneously to act to the advantage of the other.

And the three statements are not presented as standalone definitions---setting them out in a list, as above, can be misleading. In fact, the three claims emerge organically in conversation as different ways of explaining the same social phenomenon, and together they amount to a sociological theory. Thrasymachus is not confused; with his bleak social theory he is, from Plato's point of view, _dangerous_.


## High-level summary

- Definition: Justice = advantage of the stronger (ruling class).
- Implication for agents: To act justly is to advantage others, not yourself.
- Conclusion: Therefore injustice (dominating) is rational and superior.  

**Advantage of the stronger ---implies---> Advantage of the other**


## An Adornian perspective

### Thrasymachus
- Ideology is domination.
- Morality is a weapon.
- Cynical structural realism.

### Socrates/Plato
- Ideals are real.
- Society distorts them.
- Task = recover the objective good.

### Adorno
- Ideals are already distorted at the level of form.
- Society cannot “realize” them without turning them into domination.
- Task = keep ideals from becoming instruments.
- Truth emerges only as negative image, not blueprint.
