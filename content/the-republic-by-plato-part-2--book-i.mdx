**Plato, _Republic_, translated by C. D. C. Reeve, Hackett (2004)**  

In this post I'll look at the second half of Book I. This is where the Republic's central antagonist takes to the stage: Thrasymachus, unable to contain himself any longer, bursts in with his contemptuous rhetoric. When Soctrates has recovered from the shock, he cross-examines Tharasymachus in customary Socratic style.

At this stage, half way through Book I, Socrates has shown the definitions of justice offered by Cephalus, and then his son Polemarchus, to be defective:

> SOCRATES: All right. Since it has become apparent, then, that neither justice nor the just consists in benefiting friends and harming enemies, what else should one say it is?

The rest of Book I will go very roughly like this: after demanding a definition of justice from Socrates, Thrasymachus is persuaded to give his own. He claims that justice is what serves the interests of the ruling power, and defends this claim with two separate arguments: [338d–341a](#argument-one) and [343a–344c](#argument-two).

Thrasymachus is introduced in dramatic fashion:

> _Now, while we were speaking, Thrasymachus had tried many times to take over the discussion but was restrained by those sitting near him, who wanted to hear our argument to the end. When we paused after what I had just said, however, he could not keep quiet any longer: crouched up like a wild beast about to spring, he hurled himself at us as if to tear us to pieces. Polemarchus and I were frightened and flustered as he roared into our midst._

This is the beginning of Plato's portrayal of Thrasymachus as a dangerous character, and dangerous in several ways: 

- In his arrogant and confrontational manner.
- In his mercenary approach to discussion --- he refuses to give his account of justice until the others have committed to paying him.
- In the intellectual attitude he represents, that of cynical nihilism and relativism with regard to justice and truth.

## Who is Thrasymachus?

It's quite important to know who he is, and what he represents for Plato. Thrasymachus was a historical figure, well-known in his time even apart from his immortalization by Plato. He was one of the Sophists, who were freelance intellectuals --- professional instructors in rhetoric, public speaking, and argument. 

From the point of view of Socrates, they love the sound of their own voices, indulging themselves in artful or domineering speeches rather than entering into back-and-forth dialogue. He sees them as seeking, not truth, but _victory_ --- an inevitability considering they are doing it for money.

Crucially, according to Socrates and Plato, these intellectual vices are the fertile ground on which grows the philosophy of moral nihilism and relativism. It is no coincidence that Thrasymachus, whose use of argument and speech is merely instrumental, also believes that _justice_ is merely instrumental, a cynical means to the ends of power and wealth. As a mercenary thinker, Thrasymachus cannot help but think of justice as mercenary too.

Thrasymachus is thus portrayed as aggressive, contemptuous, eager to speak more than to listen, impatient with the give-and-take of enquiry --- and when the argument turns against him, he effectively throws his toys out of the pram, petulantly withdrawing instead of openly yielding rationally.

An admirer of tyrants, he is himself the _intellectual_ tyrant of the Republic. And more than that, his soul is disordered, as Socrates will indirectly explain later on. It's not much of an exaggeration to say that the entire Republic aims to defeat everything Thrasymachus represents.


## High-level summary
- Definition: Justice = advantage of the stronger (ruling class).
- Implication for agents: To act justly is to advantage others, not yourself.
- Conclusion: Therefore injustice (dominating) is rational and superior.  

**Advantage of the stronger ---implies---> Advantage of the other**


## An Adornian perspective

### Thrasymachus
- Ideology is domination.
- Morality is a weapon.
- Cynical structural realism.

### Socrates/Plato
- Ideals are real.
- Society distorts them.
- Task = recover the objective good.

### Adorno
- Ideals are already distorted at the level of form.
- Society cannot “realize” them without turning them into domination.
- Task = keep ideals from becoming instruments.
- Truth emerges only as negative image, not blueprint.
