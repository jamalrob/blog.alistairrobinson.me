**Plato, _Republic_, translated by C. D. C. Reeve, Hackett (2004)**

In this post I'll look at the second half of Book I. This is where the Republic's main antagonist takes to the stage: Thrasymachus, unable to contain himself any longer, bursts into the conversation with his impatient, contemptuous rhetoric. When Socrates recovers from the shock, he cross-examines Thrasymachus in his customary style.

Before I say more, recall the two central questions of the republic:

(1) What is justice?  
(2) Is the just life more personally beneficial than the unjust life? Or, is the just life _happier_ than the unjust life?

Thrasymachus has answers:

<aside class="callout">
  <h4>Thrasymachus's claims</h4>
  <p>Thrasymachus will say that justice is what is advantageous for the stronger; and that injustice is advantageous for oneself, provided one is the stronger.</p>
</aside>

Thus he offers a definition and a claim about what benefits the agent. Note that "the stronger" should be understood as _the ruler_. 

I said Thrasymachus was the work's main antagonist, but on a first read this can escape notice, because after Book I he doesn't appear again and is hardly mentioned. This is because he is not the antagonist in the familiar dramatic sense but in a spiritual or conceptual sense. It is therefore quite easy to miss the strong hints that the rest of the work is aimed at a more comprehensive defeat of the position that Thrasymachus represents than Socrates can manage in his direct examination of that position in Book I.

This is the meaning of the structure of the Republic, beginning with the back-and-forth of the Socratic _elenchus_ in Book I, then progressing to an expansive and more positive theoretical exploration in what follows. The failure of Thrasymachus to sustain his position under Socrates's examination is not enough to persuade the others that he is wrong, or rather---given that they probably do believe so intuitively---it is not enough to bring up to the level of consciously articulated knowledge precisely _how_ he is wrong. For that, Socrates needs to present them with a coherent and convincing system against which Thrasymachus's position shows up as false.

Which reminds me of Wittgenstein:

> 141. When we first begin to _believe_ anything, what we believe is not a single proposition, it is a whole system of propositions. (Light dawns gradually over the whole.)
>
> 142. It is not single axioms that strike me as obvious, it is a system in which consequences and premises give one another _mutual_ support.
>
> --- _On Certainty_

Plato knows this, which is why, after Book I, he goes to the effort of carefully painting a picture of his entire conception of the city and the soul.

Returning to Book I...

At this stage, half way through, Socrates has revealed the defectiveness of the definitions of justice offered by Cephalus and then his son Polemarchus:

> SOCRATES: All right. Since it has become apparent, then, that neither justice nor the just consists in benefiting friends and harming enemies, what else should one say it is?

The rest of Book I will go very roughly like this:

1. Thrasymachus demands to hear Socrates's definition of justice
2. Socrates and the others persuade him to give his own definition (partly by paying him)
3. Thrasymachus claims that ***justice is what serves the interests of the ruling power***
4. He argues for this from [338d to 341a](#argument-one).
5. Socrates, by elenchus, shows him that no ruler, insofar as he is actually a ruler, is interested in or promotes what is advantageous for himself.
6. Thrasymachus offers another argument for his claim. This goes from [343a–344c](#argument-two).
7. Socrates, by elenchus, shows that a just person is good and wise, and
an unjust one ignorant and bad. This causes Thrasymachus to blush.
8. Socrates goes on to show that not only is injustice ignorant and bad, but it doesn't bring happiness or profit either.

notes/
  after demanding a definition of justice from Socrates, Thrasymachus is persuaded to give his own. He claims that ***justice is what serves the interests of the ruling power***, and defends this claim with two separate arguments: [338d–341a](#argument-one) and [343a–344c](#argument-two).
/notes

Thrasymachus is introduced in dramatic fashion:

> _Now, while we were speaking, Thrasymachus had tried many times to take over the discussion but was restrained by those sitting near him, who wanted to hear our argument to the end. When we paused after what I had just said, however, he could not keep quiet any longer: crouched up like a wild beast about to spring, he hurled himself at us as if to tear us to pieces. Polemarchus and I were frightened and flustered as he roared into our midst._
>
> [336a]

This initiates Plato's portrayal of Thrasymachus as a dangerous character, and dangerous in several ways: 

- In his arrogant and confrontational manner.
- In his mercenary approach to discussion---as we'll see, he refuses to give his account of justice until the others have committed to paying him.
- In the intellectual attitude he represents, that of cynical nihilism and relativism with regard to justice and truth.

## Who is Thrasymachus?

It helps to know who he is, and what he represents for Plato. Thrasymachus was a historical figure, well-known in his time even apart from his immortalization by Plato. He was one of the Sophists, who were freelance intellectuals---professional instructors in rhetoric, public speaking, and argument. 

From the point of view of Socrates, the Sophists love the sound of their own voices, indulging themselves in artful or domineering speeches rather than entering into a back-and-forth dialogue on the way to truth. He sees them as seeking, not truth at all, but _victory_---perhaps inevitable considering they're doing it for money.

Crucially, according to Socrates and Plato, these intellectual vices are the fertile ground on which grows the philosophy of moral nihilism and relativism. It is no coincidence that Thrasymachus, whose use of argument and speech is merely instrumental, also believes that virtues such as _justice_ are merely instrumental, a cynical means to the ends of power and wealth. Representing a mercenary intellectual tradition, Thrasymachus naturally frames justice as mercenary too.

So he is portrayed as aggressive, contemptuous, eager to speak more than to listen, impatient with the give-and-take of enquiry---and when the argument turns against him, he effectively throws his toys out of the pram, petulantly withdrawing instead of openly yielding rationally.

An admirer of tyrants, he is himself the _intellectual_ tyrant of the Republic. As such, he has a soul which is disordered, like the society ruled by a tyrannical ruler, and Socrates will set out this parallel in depth later on.




## High-level summary

- Definition: Justice = advantage of the stronger (ruling class).
- Implication for agents: To act justly is to advantage others, not yourself.
- Conclusion: Therefore injustice (dominating) is rational and superior.  

**Advantage of the stronger ---implies---> Advantage of the other**


## An Adornian perspective

### Thrasymachus
- Ideology is domination.
- Morality is a weapon.
- Cynical structural realism.

### Socrates/Plato
- Ideals are real.
- Society distorts them.
- Task = recover the objective good.

### Adorno
- Ideals are already distorted at the level of form.
- Society cannot “realize” them without turning them into domination.
- Task = keep ideals from becoming instruments.
- Truth emerges only as negative image, not blueprint.
