In this article I'll look at the second half of Book I. This is where the Republic's main antagonist enters the stage: Thrasymachus, unable to contain himself any longer, bursts into the conversation with his impatient, contemptuous rhetoric. When Socrates recovers from the shock, he cross-examines Thrasymachus in his customary style.

Recall the two central questions of the republic:

1. What is justice?  
2. Is the just life more personally beneficial than the unjust life? Or, is the just life _happier_ than the unjust life?

Thrasymachus will have answers:

<aside class="callout">
  <strong><em>Thrasymachus's claims</em></strong>
    <ol>
      <li>Justice is what is advantageous for the stronger (the ruler).</li>
      <li>The just life is <em>not</em> more personally beneficial than the unjust life. On the contrary, it is injustice which is advantageous to oneself.</li>
    </ol>
</aside>

Thus he will offer a definition and a claim about what benefits the agent. As noted, "the stronger" should be understood as _the ruler_. 

I said Thrasymachus was the work's main antagonist, but on a first read this can escape notice, because after Book I he doesn't appear again and is hardly mentioned. This is because he is not the antagonist in the familiar dramatic sense but in a spiritual or conceptual sense: the rest of the work aims to defeat _the position that Thrasymachus represents_, and to do so more comprehensively than Socrates can manage in his direct examination of that position in Book I.

This is the meaning of the structure of the Republic, beginning with the back-and-forth of the Socratic _elenchus_ in Book I, then progressing to an expansive and more positive theoretical exploration in what follows. The failure of Thrasymachus to sustain his position under Socrates's examination is not enough to persuade the others that he is wrong, or rather---given that they probably do believe so intuitively---it is not enough to bring up to the level of consciously articulated knowledge precisely _how_ he is wrong. For that, Socrates needs to present them with a coherent and convincing system against which Thrasymachus's position shows up as false.

Which reminds me of Wittgenstein:

> 141. When we first begin to _believe_ anything, what we believe is not a single proposition, it is a whole system of propositions. (Light dawns gradually over the whole.)
>
> 142. It is not single axioms that strike me as obvious, it is a system in which consequences and premises give one another _mutual_ support.
>
> --- _On Certainty_

Plato knows this, which is why, after Book I, he goes to the effort of carefully painting a picture of his entire conception of the city and the soul.

## Who is Thrasymachus?  

It helps to know who he is, and what he represents for Plato. Thrasymachus was a historical figure, well-known in his time even apart from his immortalization by Plato. He was one of the sophists, a class of freelance intellectuals---professional instructors in public speaking and argument. 

From the point of view of Socrates, the sophists love the sound of their own voices, crafting artfully persuasive or domineering speeches rather than joining a communal effort to search for truth. He sees them as seeking, not truth at all, but _victory_---perhaps inevitable considering they're doing it for money.

Crucially, according to Socrates and Plato, these intellectual vices are fertile ground for the growth of moral nihilism and relativism. It is no coincidence that Thrasymachus, whose use of argument and speech in his everyday life is merely instrumental, also believes that virtues such as _justice_ are merely instrumental, a cynical means to the ends of power and wealth. Representing a mercenary intellectual tradition, Thrasymachus naturally frames justice as mercenary too.

So he is portrayed as aggressive, contemptuous, eager to speak more than to listen, impatient with the give-and-take of enquiry---and when the argument turns against him, he effectively throws his toys out of the pram, petulantly withdrawing instead of openly yielding according to the dictates of reason.

An admirer of tyrants, he is himself the _intellectual_ tyrant of the Republic. As such, he has a soul which is disordered, like the society ruled by a tyrant, and Socrates will set out this parallel in depth later on.

## Summary

A preliminary summary will help. The second half of Book I goes like this:

1. Thrasymachus demands to hear Socrates's definition of justice
2. Socrates and the others persuade him to give his own definition (partly by paying him)
3. Thrasymachus claims that ***justice is what serves the interests of the ruling power***. [338b]
4. He argues for this from [338d to 341a](#argument-one).
5. Socrates, by elenchus, challenges his definition and shows him that ruling, considered as a craft, aims at the good of the ruled rather than the ruler. ([341c-342e](#elenchus-one))
6. Thrasymachus's long speech, offering another argument for his claim. This goes from [343a to 344c](#argument-two).
7. Socrates, by elenchus, turns away from the definition _as such_, to challenge Thrasymachus's claim about benefit and happiness. First he shows that a just person is good and wise, and an unjust one ignorant and bad. This causes Thrasymachus to blush. ([345b-350d](#elenchus-blush))
8. Socrates continues, showing that not only is injustice ignorant and bad, but it doesn't bring happiness or profit either. ([350d-354a](#elenchus-two))

## The dialogue

By the time we get half way through Book I, Socrates has revealed the defectiveness of the definitions of justice offered by Cephalus and then his son Polemarchus:

> SOCRATES: All right. Since it has become apparent, then, that neither justice nor the just consists in benefiting friends and harming enemies, what else should one say it is?

This is when Thrasymachus is introduced, in dramatic fashion:

> _Now, while we were speaking, Thrasymachus had tried many times to take over the discussion but was restrained by those sitting near him, who wanted to hear our argument to the end. When we paused after what I had just said, however, he could not keep quiet any longer: crouched up like a wild beast about to spring, he hurled himself at us as if to tear us to pieces. Polemarchus and I were frightened and flustered as he roared into our midst._
>
> [336a]

This initiates Plato's portrayal of Thrasymachus the sophist as a dangerous character, and dangerous in several ways: 

- In his arrogant and confrontational manner.
- In his mercenary approach to discussion---as we'll see, he refuses to give his account of justice until the others have committed to paying him.
- In the intellectual attitude he represents, that of cynical nihilism and relativism with regard to justice and truth.

He roars into their midst with this:

> What nonsense you two have been talking all this time, Socrates! Why do you act like naïve people, giving way to one another? If you really want to know what justice is, don’t just ask questions and then indulge your love of honor by refuting the answers. You know very well it is easier to ask questions than to answer them. Give an answer yourself and tell us what _you_ say the just is.
> 
> [336b]

Plato here draws our attention to a fundamental difference in philosophical approach. Socrates favours questions and dialogue, whereas Thrasymachus favours opinion and speechifying.

### Irony

Socrates's response prompts Thrasymachus to accuse him of being ironic, and this is an accusation that's been levelled at Socrates ever since, right up to the present day. And it's easy to see why. Phrases such as "Don't be too hard on us," "my friend," and "you clever people" seem ironic in the extreme. However, his emphasis on the seriousness and value of the search for justice is sincere. Thus we have _ironic tone, serious intent_.

But what is the point of the ironic tone? I think it's a subtle combination of provocation and defence, provoking Thrasymachus at the same time as defending against his violence---Socrates faces up to him without, however, meeting him on his own ground, i.e., with violence.

And he carries on in this mode:

> That is because you are a wise fellow, Thrasymachus.
>
> [337a]

Thrasymachus continues to demand Socrates's definition of justice until Socrates turns it around, at [338a]. And Thrasymachus obliges:

> THRASYMACHUS: Listen, then. I say justice is nothing other than what is advantageous for the stronger. Well, why don’t you praise me? No, you are unwilling.
>
> [338b]
<a name="argument-one"><br/></a>
## Thrasymachus's first argument 

Under pressure from Socrates, at [338d] he clarifies that "the stronger" is the ruling power, whether in an aristocracy, a democracy, or a tyranny. But Socrates shows that Thrasymachus's account is internally contradictory:

> SOCRATES: And are the rulers in each city infallible, or are they liable to error?  
>
> THRASYMACHUS: No doubt, they are liable to error.  
>
> [...]  
>
> SOCRATES: And whatever laws the rulers make must be obeyed by their subjects, and that is what is just?  
>
> THRASYMACHUS: Of course.  
>
> SOCRATES: According to your account, then, it isn’t only just to do what is advantageous for the stronger, but also the opposite: what is not advantageous.  
>
> [339c]

Given that rulers are sometimes in error about what is of advantage to them, and given that their subjects, in obeying the law, are acting justly, it follows that sometimes the subjects will sometimes act to the disadvantage of the ruler. The assertion that justice is lawfulness is one that Socrates will question later on, but at this point he is going along with Thrasymachus, who presupposes it.

Clitophon intervenes to save Thrasymachus:

> CLITOPHON: But what he meant by what is advantageous for the stronger is what the stronger _believes_ to be advantageous for him. That is what he maintained the weaker must do, and that is what he maintained is what is just.
>
> [340b]

But Thrasymachus rejects this solution. Since accepting it would save his account from Socrates's immediate objection, we have to ask why.

If Thrasymachus were to agree that acting justly is doing what the ruler _believes to be_ to their advantage, then his position would be a subjectivist one: justice is whatever the ruler thinks is good. Thrasymachus may be a cynic, but he wants to say more than this. He wants to make a structural point, that justice is objectively the ruler's benefit, that ruling _just is_ to exploit everyone else to one's advantage, and that this is wise. The account is of a _polis_ which is operated to achieve this, with a normative force as to what one should do. The position that justice is merely what the ruler _believes_ is advantageous is too weak to achieve this. 

Even worse, Clitophon's solution---amounting to an observation that rulers pass laws to benefit themselves, and name this justice---invites the idea that although the rulers give their exploitative systems the name of justice, it is actually not justice at all. And if Thrasymachus accepted _that_, he would completely undermine his own position, because he would no longer be giving an account of justice at all, but only _how certain people use the term_.

Since Clitophon effectively identifies justice with conformity to the ruler's laws, whether or not they benefit the ruler, he is implying a kind of legalism. In contrast, Thrasymachus is presenting a radical theory about power.

- **Legalism (Clitophon):** Justice is whatever the law says.  
- **Theory of power (Thrasymachus)**: Justice is the system by which the stronger secure their advantage.

To support this position, Thrasymachus must hold that a ruler never errs insofar as he is a ruler, that when he errs he is not properly doing his job of ruling. Or in classically philosophical terms, a ruler _qua_ ruler necessarily acts to his own advantage, since that is what ruling _is_.

Thrasymachus states this explicitly [340c-340e] and explains himself according to the scheme, already introduced by Socrates in his exchange with Polemarchus, in which justice is treated as a craft, one among many others such as medicine or accountancy.

He then distinguishes between ordinary and precise usage. We are to understand that when he earlier agreed that rulers are fallible [339c], he meant it in the ordinary sense. In the precise sense of "ruler," rulers never err as to what benefits them.

He concludes:

> THRASYMACHUS: [...] No craftsman, wise man, or ruler makes an error at the moment when he is ruling, even though everyone will say that a physician or a ruler makes errors. It is in this loose way that you must also take the answer I gave just now. But the most precise answer is this: a ruler, to the extent that he is a ruler, never makes errors and unerringly decrees what is best for himself, and that is what his subject must do. Thus, as I said from the first, it is just to do what is advantageous for the stronger.

> [340e]

<a name="elenchus-one"><br/></a>
## First elenchus

Socrates begins his examination of Thrasymachus's position:

> SOCRATES: [...] Tell me: is a doctor—in the precise sense, the one you mentioned before—a moneymaker or someone who treats the sick?
>
> [341c]

He then argues to the conclusion that in the exercise of any craft, the practitioner aims not at his own benefit, but at the benefit of that which the craft is concerned with. A doctor _in the precise sense_ aims at the benefit of his patients, not of himself. A sea captain _in the precise sense_ aims at the benefit of his sailors and "his subject" [342e], i.e., the sailing of ships. NOTE: At this point I won't set out or question the argument itself.

We thus see a consequence of Thrasymachus's distinction between ordinary and precise language that ultimately undermines his own position. Socrates has met Thrasymachus's view head-on and shown that, given the precise framing that Thrasymachus has himself put forward, its implications contradict the original definition. A ruler _qua_ ruler aims at the benefit of that which he rules over, i.e., the people and the _polis_.

To get there Socrates has accepted a few of Thrasymachus's premises, for the sake of argument. It is not important at this stage to work out whether Socrates _really_ accepts them---that justice is a craft like others, and that we can distinguish between ordinary and precise usage in the way suggested. His aim at this point is just to reveal that Thrasymachus's view has internal inconsistencies. This is a textbook example of _elenchus_.

Notice that Thrasymachus has been made to agree to every step along the way. From here, he cannot easily escape. His strategy is contemptuous ridicule---insulting Socrates and accusing him of naivety---and rhetoric. 
<a name="argument-one"><br/></a>
## Thrasymachus's second argument 

This is delivered in the form of a long speech. Again Plato is signalling a lack of intellectual honesty in the sophistic approach: Thrasymachus is trying to steamroll Socrates and the others into conceding, partly with an appeal to common sense. He says it's naive to think that a shepherd aims at the benefit of his sheep rather than at his own benefit. Obviously, aiming for the benefit of your sheep is (normally) a short-term means to a self-interested end. 

I find much of the secondary literature quite alienating, regarding this particular part of Book I. In a somewhat pearl-clutching manner it emphasizes Thrasymachus's bad behaviour---insults, rhetoric, speechifying, and so on---and seems to assume that his speech is entirely illegitimate. But I surely can't have been alone in cheering him on, relieved that someone is willing to question Socrates's ideal abstractions and logical trickery, bringing things down to earth. I was on Thrasymachus's side at this point, and thought that Socrates deserved the insults. 

Whether or not that implies I'm a bad person (or possess a disordered soul), Thrasymachus is surely right to question the notion that a practitioner of a craft never aims at their own benefit. This seems to suggest that Socrates has used some sleight of hand.

It might be unfair to accuse Socrates of cheating, but he certainly is working with a controversial concept of craft, one that makes his conclusion inevitable.

### Competing concepts of craft

It helps to frame these in terms of means and ends.

**Socrates:**
- A craft is defined by its _constitutive_ end (_telos_).
- That end is the good of the craft’s subject, not of the practitioner.
- The practitioner’s benefit (wages, power) is external to the craft (this is why he says that wage-earning is a separate craft).
- Success is measured by how well the craft realizes its defining function.

So medicine is for health, shepherding is for the sheep, and ruling, if it is a craft, is for the good of the ruled.

**Thrasymachus:**
- A craft is defined importantly by the _ends_ of the practitioner.
- The practitioner’s own advantage is the ultimate end.
- The apparent good of the subject of the craft is a means to that end.
- Success is measured by how effectively the craft secures the practitioner’s benefit.

So shepherding is for the shepherd’s profit, ruling is for the ruler’s advantage, and justice names the successful operation of these arrangements, that is, the obedience of the people.

The latter conception is surely the intuitive one, certainly today. The trouble is, if we also accept that ruling and justice are crafts, then we have to say that they are basically self-interested. Thus we end up with a view that is either entirely immoralist---if we side with the ruler---or entirely pessimistic and cynical.




## Is Thrasymachus incoherent?

Some scholars have puzzled over the supposed inconsistency of Thrasymachus's stated views:

1. Justice is the advantage of the stronger.
2. Justice is obedience to the laws.
3. Justice is the advantage of the other.

On the surface, it looks like these cannot all be true. If you are the stronger, then according to (1) justice is to my advantage, but according to (2) it is to the _other's_ advantage. This objection has always struck me as pedantic, and I don't get any sense of incoherence when I read Book I, which suggests to me that Plato did not intend to _portray_ Thrasymachus as incoherent. 

What the above statements hide is that the claims are indexical, indexed to the agent's standpoint, where the agent is assumed not to be the ruler. The presupposition is that _the stronger_ and _the other_ are identical. The discussion is about what is best from one's own point of view as the person who is acting justly, so _the stronger_ means _the one who is stronger than oneself_. So, to act justly is to act to the advantage of who is more powerful than oneself, which is of course simultaneously to act to the advantage of the other.

And the three statements are not presented as standalone definitions---setting them out in a list, as above, can be misleading. In fact, the three claims emerge organically in conversation as different ways of explaining the same social phenomenon, and together they amount to a sociological theory. Thrasymachus is not confused; with his bleak social theory he is, from Plato's point of view, _dangerous_.


## High-level summary

- Definition: Justice = advantage of the stronger (ruling class).
- Implication for agents: To act justly is to advantage others, not yourself.
- Conclusion: Therefore injustice (dominating) is rational and superior.  

**Advantage of the stronger ---implies---> Advantage of the other**


## An Adornian perspective

### Thrasymachus
- Ideology is domination.
- Morality is a weapon.
- Cynical structural realism.

### Socrates/Plato
- Ideals are real.
- Society distorts them.
- Task = recover the objective good.

### Adorno
- Ideals are already distorted at the level of form.
- Society cannot “realize” them without turning them into domination.
- Task = keep ideals from becoming instruments.
- Truth emerges only as negative image, not blueprint.
