**Plato, _Republic_, translated by C. D. C. Reeve, Hackett (2004)**  

In this post I'll look at the second half of Book I, in which Thrasymachus bursts in with his contemptuous rhetoric, and Soctrates cross-examines him in his customary manner.

At this stage, half way through Book I, Socrates has shown the definitions offered by Cephalus and then his son Polemarchus to be defective:

> SOCRATES: All right. Since it has become apparent, then, that neither justice nor the just consists in benefiting friends and harming enemies, what else should one say it is?

The rest of Book I will go very roughly like this: after demanding a definition of justice from Socrates, Thrasymachus is persuaded to give his own. He claims that justice is what serves the interests of the ruling power, and defends this claim with two separate arguments: [338d–341a](#argument-one) and [343a–344c](#argument-two).

Thrasymachus is introduced in dramatic fashion:

> _Now, while we were speaking, Thrasymachus had tried many times to take over the discussion but was restrained by those sitting near him, who wanted to hear our argument to the end. When we paused after what I had just said, however, he could not keep quiet any longer: crouched up like a wild beast about to spring, he hurled himself at us as if to tear us to pieces. Polemarchus and I were frightened and flustered as he roared into our midst._

This is the beginning of Plato's portrayal of Thrasymachus as a dangerous character, and dangerous in several ways: in his arrogant and confrontational manner; in his mercenary approach to discussion (he refuses to give his account of justice until the others have committed to paying him); and in the intellectual attitude he represents, that of cynical nihilism.

## Who is Thrasymachus?

It's quite important to know who he is, and what he represents for Plato. Thrasymachus was a historical figure, well-known in his time even apart from his immortalization by Plato.


## High-level summary
- Definition: Justice = advantage of the stronger (ruling class).
- Implication for agents: To act justly is to advantage others, not yourself.
- Conclusion: Therefore injustice (dominating) is rational and superior.  

**Advantage of the stronger ---implies---> Advantage of the other**


## An Adornian perspective

### Thrasymachus
- Ideology is domination.
- Morality is a weapon.
- Cynical structural realism.

### Socrates/Plato
- Ideals are real.
- Society distorts them.
- Task = recover the objective good.

### Adorno
- Ideals are already distorted at the level of form.
- Society cannot “realize” them without turning them into domination.
- Task = keep ideals from becoming instruments.
- Truth emerges only as negative image, not blueprint.
