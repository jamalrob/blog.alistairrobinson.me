    	<p><span class="caps">SHORT</span> <span class="caps">ESSAYS</span> (2 sides A4)</p>

	<p>Topics for the first coursework assignment, first deadline Thursday 23rd October 1. In the Preface, what does Kant mean by saying that objects must accommodate themselves to our knowledge? What objections might be made against his position, and how might a Kantian reply? 2. In the Introduction, how does Kant argue that we have synthetic apriori knowledge, and what does he mean by this? What arguments could be given against our having such knowledge, and how might a Kantian reply?</p>

	<p>Topics for the second coursework assignment, first deadline Thursday 20th November. This must be in the form of a dialogue. 1. In the Transcendental Aesthetic, what does Kant mean by saying that space is the form of outer sense, and a â€˜non-thing&#8217; if taken as existing in itself? How could it be argued that space exists independently of human beings, and how might a Kantian reply? 2. In the Metaphysical Deduction, what grounds does Kant give for his claim that a complete list of categories can be derived from formal logic? What arguments could be raised against his position, and how might a Kantian reply?</p>

	<p>Topics for the third coursework essay, first deadline Thursday 12th February 1. In the Transcendental Deduction, how does Kant argue that we can know objects of experience only by applying the categories to what is given in sensation? What arguments could be raised against Kant&#8217;s position, and how might a Kantian reply? 2. In the Transcendental Deduction, what evidence is there that Kant believed in the possibility of non-human, sentient, rational beings? Would they have to have the same categories as us, and if not, would this be fatal to Kant&#8217;s claim that the categories are objective?</p>

		<li>Hume and Kant on Causation (Causality?)</li>
		<li>In the Transcendental Aesthetic, Kant attempts to prove that space and time are subjective conditions of human sensibility, not features of things in themselves. How does this argument work? Is it successful? (BLook, paper 1)</li>
		<li>How does transcendental idealism differ from Berkeley&#8217;s idealism? How are they related?</li>
		<li>In Kant, the primary qualities are given through intuition. How does he deal with the secondary qualities? What is their relation to the cognizing subject and the thing-in-itself? (from photographer, <a href="http://forums.philosophyforums.com/threads/reading-group-kant-47793-4.html">here</a>) (&#8220;The discussion of secondary qualities occurs in A28-29/B44-45, and A45/B62; but really comes to a head in B69-70. There&#8217;s some further discussion in A258/B313-314&#8221;) B35 too? Secondary qualities are <em>given</em> to us in sensation, and primary qualities are <em>supplied</em> by us. Is this right? Is it a paradox?</li>

<hr />

	<p>What does Kant mean when he says that the Critique &#8220;is a treatise on the method, not a system of the science [of metaphysics] itself&#8221; (B.xxii)? How can the Transcendental Aesthetic and the Analytic of Concepts be regarded as &#8220;method&#8221;? Was this a good understanding of his own project?</p>

	<p>What in Hume awoke Kant from his &#8220;dogmatic slumber&#8221; (Prolegomena, 260; cf. 337)? What was Hume&#8217;s challenge to Kant and what was Kant&#8217;s answer to Hume? How well did Kant meet Hume&#8217;s challenge?</p>

	<p>Kant hears &#8220;a call to reason to undertake anew the most difficult of all its tasks, namely, that of self-knowledge, and to institute a tribunal&#8230;&#8221; (A.xi). What is the relation between the tasks of self-knowledge and the institution of a tribunal? How is the Transcendental Deduction part of the search for self-knowledge and part of the institution of the tribunal?</p>

	<p>What is a number for Kant? Why is arithmetic synthetic rather than analytic knowledge? Is Kant right about this?</p>

	<p>Kant describes the question whether synthetic a priori judgments are possible as &#8220;the proper problem of pure reason&#8221; (B.19) and &#8220;the general problem of transcendental philosophy&#8221; (B.73). He tells us that the Aesthetic provided &#8220;one of the factors required for a solution&#8221; (B.73) and that the rest of the answer is to come. Pull together all the parts of his answer and state it as a whole. What reasons does he offer for the truth of his answer?</p>

	<p>What is the &#8220;clue to the discovery of all pure concepts of the understanding&#8221; (B.91ff)? How does Kant use this clue actually to discover, or justify, or expound, his tables of judgments and categories? Insofar as the clue can be put in propositional form, state it and show what arguments, if any, Kant offers for its truth? Is it really true? Does it justify the inferences that Kant draws from it?</p>

	<p>What is the relation between the table of judgments and the table of categories? Why does Kant need both? How do the answers to these questions illuminate the argument of the Deduction?</p>

	<p>In the Prolegomena (p. 322) Kant says that the search for the &#8220;elements of a grammar&#8221; and for a complete table of categories &#8220;are very nearly related&#8221;. What is the relation?</p>

	<p>Pick one difference of doctrine (as opposed to exposition) between the A and the B editions of the Transcendental Deduction. What argumentative strategies, programmatic motives, or doctrinal pressures might explain why Kant made the change? Is the change an improvement?</p>

	<p>Kant says the task of the Transcendental Deduction (in one of his many formulations) is to explain &#8220;how subjective conditions of thought can have objective validity&#8221; (B.122). How does the Deduction provide such an explanation, and what explanation does it provide?</p>

	<p>What is the transcendental unity of apperception? What role does it play in the arguments of the A and B versions of the Transcendental Deduction?</p>

	<p>What is the theory of the self, or of the types of self and their relations, that emerges from the Transcendental Deduction?</p>

	<p>How do the arguments of the Transcendental Deduction explain the statement that &#8220;the understanding determines the sensibility&#8221; (B.161.n)?</p>

	<p>How do the arguments of the Transcendental Deduction explain Kant&#8217;s discussion of the &#8220;epigenesis&#8221; and &#8220;pre-formation system&#8221; of pure reason (B.167). What conclusion(s) does he draw from this discussion?</p>

	<p>What is a transcendental deduction (and what are forms of intuition and concepts of understanding) such that we must have a transcendental deduction for concepts of understanding but not for forms of intuition?</p>

	<p>In several places Kant says that if we could know things in themselves, there could be no a priori knowledge. (See esp. B.xvii-xxii.) What is his argument? Is he right?</p>

	<p>What is Kant&#8217;s notion of a thing in itself? Exactly what does he know and not know about things in themselves? What is his argument that the unknowable aspects of them are unknowable? What are his reasons for positing them?</p>

	<p>How does Kant distinguish appearance from illusion? If the world of experience (or appearances) is constituted by the knower, then why isn&#8217;t it illusory?</p>

	<p>What is Kant&#8217;s revolutionary proposal? He calls it an experiment or hypothesis (B.xvi, B.xxii.n), but assures that it will be fully proved in the text (B.xxii.n) and even anticipates the proof in the B Preface (B.xx-xxi). Pull together the various parts of the proof and state it clearly in logical order.</p>

	<p>What is Kant&#8217;s concept of experience? Why does he insist on the distinction between experience and possible experience? Does his theory of experience make him an empiricist?</p>

	<p>Is Kant&#8217;s reliance on Aristotelian logic, Newtonian physics and Euclidian geometry a problem for his position? (see here: http://hkbu.academia.edu/StephenPalmquist/Papers/189736/The&#95;Kantian&#95;Grounding&#95;of&#95;Einsteins&#95;Worldview&#95;I&#95;The&#95;Early&#95;Influence&#95;of&#95;Kants&#95;System&#95;of&#95;Perspectives)</p>
