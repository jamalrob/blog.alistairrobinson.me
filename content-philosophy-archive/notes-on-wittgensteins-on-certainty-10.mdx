> 287\. The squirrel does not infer by induction that it is going to need stores next winter as well. And no more do we need a law of induction to justify our actions or our predictions.

> 288\. I know, not just that the earth existed long before my birth, but also that it is a large body, that this has been established, that I and the rest of mankind have forebears, that there are books about all this, that such books don’t lie, etc. etc. etc. And I know all this? I believe it. This body of knowledge has been handed on to me and I have no grounds for doubting it, but, on the contrary, all sorts of confirmation.  
> And why shouldn’t I say that I know all this? Isn’t that what one does say?  
> But not only I know, or believe, all that, but the others do too. Or rather, _I believe_ that they believe it.

> 289\. I am firmly convinced that others believe, believe they know, that all that is in fact so.

> 290\. I myself wrote in my book that children learn to understand a word in such and such a way. Do I know that, or do I believe it? Why in such a case do I write not “I believe etc.” but simply the indicative sentence?

> 291\. We know that the earth is round. We have definitively ascertained that it is round.  
> We shall stick to this opinion, unless our whole way of seeing nature changes. “How do you know that?” – I believe it.

> 292\. Further experiments cannot _give the lie_ to our earlier ones, at most they may change our whole way of looking at things.

> 293\. Similarly with the sentence “water boils at 100 C”.

> 294\. This is how we acquire conviction, this is called “being rightly convinced”.

> 295\. So hasn’t one, in this sense, a _proof_ of the proposition? But that the same thing has happened again is not a proof of it; though we do say that it gives us a right to assume it.

> 296\. This is what we _call_ an “empirical foundation” for our assumptions.

> 297\. For we learn, not just that such and such experiments had those and those results, but also the conclusion which is drawn. And of course there is nothing wrong in our doing so. For this inferred proposition is an instrument for a definitive use.

> 298\. 'We are quite sure of it’ does not mean just that every single person is certain of it, but that we belong to a community which is bound together by science and education.

> 299\. We are satisfied that the earth is round.
